Welcome to the Weekly News Summaries megathread. Why does this thread exist? Daily news summaries are not allowed anymore since they were viewed as excessive. In response, the mod team created the Weekly News Summaries megathread for consolidating all periodic news summaries. The goal is to level the playing field between contributors while also creating a convenient all-in-one format for readers to enjoy. 

**STRUCTURE**

All r/CC rules apply. Only approved contributors are allowed to make top-level comments, ie summaries. Summaries will be sorted by contest mode. This thread will posted every Sunday at 12PM CST and pinned once a week if an open slot is available. 

Contributors can submit summaries on news articles, coin prices, sentiment, or any crypto related subject. Contributors will post content at their earliest convenience so it might be advantageous if you use the RES extension to subscribe to this thread and find out when content is posted. 

**APPROVED CONTRIBUTORS:**

*  u/itachiwriting
* u/Gotestthat
* u/Aegontarg07

**RECRUITING CONTRIBUTORS**

If you have a new type of summary and want to become an approved contributor, submit an application in r/CryptoRecruiting.  In your application, ignore most of the questions pertaining to mod recruiting. Simply state what your background is, how much account age and karma you have, and what your news summary will be about. Providing a small preview for your summary will be helpful. If your application is not approved, you can do your own weekly news summaries as a separate post.

Be advised, this thread is experimental and a work in progress. Expect future changes."|1632080115.0

This is actually hilarious, because as I like to bet some money on sports (just a little bit for fun) and I‚Äôve never received a message about the dangers of gambling.

There has been so many cases of lives being ruined by gambling and if the bank want to advise us about something, they should advise us about not gambling instead of investing crypto..

In the end, I do understand their point. They are probably scared shaking about crypto‚Äôs threat to their banking system."|1632075338.0

Here a link from the earlier post : https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pr2g6v/a_dormant_address_containing_616_btc_has_just/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

As a redditor point out, it might be a Silk Road dealer that got out of jail! 

So just imagine you had the choice between living your normal life, struggling to quit the rat race OR go to jail for 8.8 years with 616BTC you can reclaim once you're out of jail.

On one hand, you're free with limited resources. 

On the other hand, you exchange 8.8 years of misery againt spending the rest of your life with resources to do anything you want.

5|Be proud if you invest in cryptocurrencies, no matter if it is $20 or $100. We, ordinary people with small capital, are the reason why all this exists.|297|prk6q3|CryptoCurrency|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/prk6q3/be_proud_if_you_invest_in_cryptocurrencies_no/|124|"When Satoshi Nakamoto was making bitcoin, he thought mostly of us, ordinary people with low incomes. 

He was thinking on people living in corrupt states or dictatorships and had a vision of how his project could help the common man to be financially independent of such systems. 

That is why you should be proud if you invest in some quality cryptocurrencies because you invest money that you can afford to lose. YOU are contributing a small part to the future of that idea. 

Of course, in order for the price to be favorable, in the beginning it was necessary to invest large sums of money from people who had it. But, without ordinary people, then and now this would not exist.

All the stories, all the hype, every community, the news on television, this sub, all the miners. That's all us.

Also, if your $ 100 investment is significant for you, then your profits will also be significant. I honestly didn‚Äôt invest smart and I learned my lesson the hard way. Ever since then, when I see the opportunity and the price drop I‚Äôve been investing  around $ 30- $ 50. I hope that in time it will grow and that I will be able to invest even more. Or also, find a better paid job.For now, I know my limits and I feel great.

 So don't get discouraged when you see all those people investing thousands and millions of dollars, just keep doing your thing and stay smart!"|1632098655.0

Strong team, strong tech, deep pockets, and an investor pool with even deeper ones. However, despite all these juicy ingredients, the market does not have an appetite for what the project is cooking up. There are many of these baffling examples. However, one of the most illuminating for me has to be Algorand, a project which I covered first almost a year ago. So, what‚Äôs going on with ALGO, and is this still hope. I‚Äôll be finding out probably taking a look at the tech team use cases and adoption potential. If any, are then also analyze the price potential of our go and see if there is light at the end of the Blockchain.

What is Algorand?
What the hell is Algorand? They are a scalable, secure, and decentralized cryptocurrency and smart contract platform. They‚Äôve developed their own consensus mechanism that is a variant of proof of stake called pure proof of stake(TM). The main benefit of this is that Algorand technology finalizes blocks in seconds and provides immediate transaction finality. While preventing forks. Furthermore, Algorand offers highly customizable smart contracts as asset tokenization and atomic transfers built directly in layer 1. I‚Äôll come back to all of this tech in a bit.
The company is based in Boston and was founded by a turning award-winning MIT Professor called Silvio Micali. He has also assembled a pretty strong team from MIT and other academic institutions, given the star power behind this project."|1632103738.0

Teach a man to stake, and he will eat for life|282|prhp6u|CryptoCurrency|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/prhp6u/give_a_man_a_steak_and_he_will_eat_for_a_day/|197|"As the title suggests, I would like to discuss the efficacy of staking cryptocurrency. More specifically, I'd love to what what you guys think is the best method of staking your tokens.

For those who are new, don't worry, I've got you. To put it simply, taking is the process of earning rewards for holding certain cryptocurrencies. Payouts are (generally) given out in the cryptocurrency being staked.

Many centralised exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, Gemini etc.... Offer staking, with Binance usually giving the highest returns for altcoins. I do dabble personally in staking on these exchanges, where you can get returns of anywhere between 2 and 40 percent depending on the altcoins being staked

Another alternative is to stake on the token website, such as the case with 1inch, Uniswap, and Pancakeswap. Personally, I go with Uniswap and Pancakeswap. Pancakeswap in particular has a rather high rate of return, of just over 80 percent per annum, with built in interest compounding (aka, your best friend in your crypto staking journey).

I just want to know what you guys do as your method of earning passive income via cryptocurrency, and how it works. I guess information like this should be spread around, since I'd love to help out the members in this community in any way I can. Just a word of warning, don't solely rely on one source of information, and always do your own research before investing. I've seen too many people invest based off people like crypto Youtubers, which is not sustainable and they can often spread FUD and misinformation. As always, stay safe, stay healthy, and good luck guys :)"|1632089452.0

I knew BUSD was feeless meaning you can buy any asset in the spot market and pay zero % fees. 

But I noticed many times that fees were indeed deducted for my market orders, I did some googling and noticed it was some sort of a limited time promotion. 

But today I made a limit order for the first time in months and checked the transaction history, it's fee less!

So market orders have fees associated with them even on BUSD pair, but Limit orders are fee less.

#TL;DR: Use BUSD+Limit orders to make feeless transactions."|1632114535.0

There were exchanges (I‚Äôm looking at you Mt Gox and the 45 BTC I lost there) but anyone I knew using bitcoin was only using it to buy drugs online. Really fucking good drugs. 

If I hadn‚Äôt lost my BTC to Mt Gox and the FBI when they seized all Silk Road wallets, I would absolutely have used it to buy more hash or acid or Hulu passwords. Happily done so. Because for the first time in 15 years I could get clean acid and the idea of it being purchased and delivered to my front door anonymously was a fucking game changer

He has many videos about CryptoCurrency which seem to be decent but don't get fooled. This channel seems to be causing many Pump and Dumps and it is a source of a lot of FUD and misinformation.

His Phantasma video was the first thing I noticed.

MCap of Phantasma coin doubled during 24 hours before the BitBoy released his shilling video. It went from 35 million to over 80 million. The price of token doubled in a matter of hours. Once the video was released the Phantasma started to dump in price losing ALL profit in under an hour.

His meltdown on Twitter a couple months ago after losing a poll to Guy from CoinBureau will show you his true character.

There are also rumors (?)  that (quoting)

> he also bribes to shill shitcoins; the current rate is anywhere between 15 and 25 thousand dollars. So when he comes up with his next suggestion to buy and watch moon, realize that he was paid to pump it.

16|Like rats fleeing a sinking ship, Safemoon's core developers peel away one by one as the price plummets and one single question remains unanswered - WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?|117|pridd2|CryptoCurrency|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pridd2/like_rats_fleeing_a_sinking_ship_safemoons_core/|121|"###This will be part four of my exciting Safemoon Saga, much reviled by Safemooners. Please see below to catch up  


**///////Part 1:** [Safemoon's performance of Mental Gymnastics in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics has been simply stunning. They deserve every Gold they've been given.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p0i6kr/safemoons_performance_of_mental_gymnastics_in_the/)

**///////Part 33 &^1/3:** [Last call for Safemoon. The curtains are drawing on this omnishambles of a project.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/plait6/last_call_for_safemoon_the_curtains_are_drawing/)  

--------

What in the hell has been going on in the last week or so? Well, first, we find out that Safemoon Hank will be departing following the immense cock-up of the Safemoon wallet launch. Not one to shy away from the juicy details, we find out from leaked Discord audio that Hank and Thomas Smith (AKA, *^shudder*, """"""papa""""""), disgruntled at their roles at Safemoon, are in fact only spending a few hours per week working on Safemoon related projects and instead spending a significant proportion of their time coding their own projects.  

One of these, we find out, is called ""Piggy Token"" - which has suffered the typical BSC fate of a rude rug-pull ([oof, that 30-day chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/piggy-bank-token))  

If you look at the transcript linked above, you might find some interesting tidbits, but for the lazy I've done the honors of removing much of the sleuthing for your pleasure:  

**Safemoon Hank**
> But yeah ah, so the goal is: Piggy will make you wealthy. Our next project will make all of you and all of your families filthy rich  

#
>So Thomas and I are going to work on our own project a lot

>And since Thomas is scaled back and he only has to work 15 hours a week, we're going to put 80 hours into our project.  

Nice thought, huh? Just a product to enrich the developers and friends of the developers via a pre-sale, can't think where I've heard that one before...   

The other thing we find out is that Hank & Thomas seem really pissed off at Braden 'John' Karony - CEO of Safemoon. Trouble in paradise it seems.  


So Hank announces his departure to much ""Good riddance!"" and then the above audio leaks out. Blood is out for Hank, but also for Mr. Jack Haines, Chief Operations Officer at Safemoon who slams his notice of departure down *on the same day!*  

[The footnote here is interesting...](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E-7IElAXoAI6HhC?format=jpg&name=large)  

So that's two for two core team members bailing out to start their own projects...  

[Next up, SafeMoonDev - yes, the original developer for Safemoon has just upped and fucked off](https://preview.redd.it/qiivupw826o71.jpg?width=354&auto=webp&s=d78e9d490f84dff972e2c90c6907713634e5997a), transferring his millions of dollars of tokens to wallets in preparation to sell.  

[Selling your bags and deleting your twitter after a pseudo-cryptic message is *so* 2018.](https://twitter.com/realsafemoondev?lang=en)

*(PS - does anyone else find these blue laser eyes the Safemoon community has are just peak cringe?)*  


----------

This is an awful lot of churning for a company, even a startup, where the Chief Technology Officer (Hank) quits a couple months after a discord call took place where he gloats about creating a new Crypto to make everyone who takes part in the pre-sale rich (Piggy, which launched and then rugged)  

The Chief Blockchain Officer (Thomas) is on the ropes to quit, and though he is hero-worshipped by the cult, he's actually spent his time working on Piggy & a new token called ""NFA Token"" (Not Financial Advice Token....)  

And the Chief Operations Officer (Jack) who often appears alongside the CEO in the Safemoon Sunday's segment just leaves almost on a whim, citing personal issues (I guess I would cite personal issues if I yeeted millions of dollars out of a Cryptocurrency contract but here we are)  

---------

A new piece of audio is released, this one from the former lead Safemoon moderator ""Ginger"", the audio is between himself, plenty of other former Safemoon moderators and some skeptical community members. Once again, some juicy transcripts:  

**Ginger**
> I would argue that, what's been seen in the blockchain? There are unknown amounts of LP extracted from SafeMoon that have disappeared. There isn't a justified business expense. And it's not a misappropriation, it's simply missing! That's the problem!  

#
> The ‚ÄúFuck SafeMoon‚Äù was directed at corporate and then the cult army, were the nazis. I was told that if I went public with what we found, it would be worse for us than for the people it's regarding. And when I asked what they meant, because I took that as a threat. Their clarification was, haven't you seen the effectiveness? And how crazy the SafeMoon cult is?  


**It appears the audio from Ginger corroborates the leaked audio from Hank - that Hank & Thomas were creating their own token instead of working on Safemoon, which explains why the wallet launch was such a complete fiasco and obviously cobbled together by a team of yoo-ha's from Fiverr**  

----------

### BUT WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?!  

This one is really interesting and similar to my DoxxLocker post. We're gonna follow a chain of transactions, all nicely linked and annotated to understand what the fuck is going on with money that is supposed to be kept in a Safemoon liquidity pool. [Credit to ScamMoon on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/ScammoonR/status/1438471312746303490)  

[But first, an explanation from Thomas Smith the last time this happened](https://np.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/mlnc3i/millions_of_liquidity_removed_from_main_safemoon/gtmms7t/)  

>What you're seeing between the pancake router and the safemoon contract is a normal contract interaction. Transactions that happen from the safemoon contract address: 0x8076C74C5e3F5852037F31Ff0093Eeb8c8ADd8D3 to the pancakeswap router: 0x05fF2B0DB69458A0750badebc4f9e13aDd608C7F is automated and has happened hundreds of times. It is not initiated by the contract deployer address. The safemoon contract regularly swaps with pancakeswap, I encourage people to check the timestamps and understand that we do not have the contract functions to initiate swaps like that.

>Please know there is a difference between a deployed contract and a wallet address. While a contract can hold and potentially use a balance, it does not have a private key. The functions we have available are the only ones we have available, everyone is free to verify this with the source and explorer verified code.

In TX8, 1,800+ ETH in wallet Fart 333 is transferred to a wallet owned by someone with an account on Binance.  


###What Thomas & Safemoon team and cultists would have you believe is that these are normal movements to and from a liquidity pool. They are not.  


This is clearly money being taken from the Liquidity Pool, washed through a few wallets and then cashed out. And not just a few dollars, the final transaction into the Binance wallet came in at nearly **FOUR MILLION DOLLARS**  

And this is just one of many transactions like it - the DoxxLocker report has more. And all these transactions were highlighted as *possible* in the Certik Audit which found that the code to perform functions for the liquidity pool could allow for funds to be diverted elsewhere.  

---------

So you remember that Ginger guy from earlier? Well he stumbled onto this sort of wallet funds fuckery, in combination with the devs sending money around to fund launches of their other scam shitcoins (Piggy, NFA, Nobility) and [created an amazing mind-map of all the transactions with his own notes on them.](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lx5kv5k=/)  

That's definitely worth a look at, if you want to see more evidence of misappropriation of funds.

And there you have it, another chapter in the trainwreck of the shitcoin that gained a cult following based on absolutely nothing.

Though denying it's Evergrande debt, with default looming and its systemic effects on the China money market, this this is a Lehman Brother's-level ""Gray Rhino"" event in crypto"|314|prc5cu|CryptoCurrency|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/prc5cu/psa_stuart_hoagner_tethers_lawyer_just_basically/|246|"In the last 24 hours, $56 Billion in USDT volume was traded. That is more than Bitcoin, ETH, and the next 3 largest coins combined. It is the glue holding the world of crypto exchanges together.

I'm sure most of you have seen the movie ""The Big Short"". For the simplified cliff notes refresher - Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, huge batches of dog-shit mortgages at high risk of default were being bundled up into various securities and bonds, which were then bought and sold by financial institutions around the world. When the defaults started rolling in....bla bla bla....global financial system collapses. Any financial institution holding the dog shit went down (either ending in bankruptcy or government bailout). Cool, remember that.

So Tether FUD has been a meme since Tether was a thing...for good reason too. Since inception, the stablecoin has been caught up in a seemingly endless stream of shadiness and legal issues. A bunch of the OG Tether execs/funders charged with bank fraud, ties to other fraudulent crypto criminal activities, shady ties to Bitfinex, The NYAG suing Tether/Bitfinex and holding them liable for lying about reserves and hiding, the current DOJ investigation...etc etc

Around 2019, Tether low key changed the claim on its website from ""We are backed 1-to-1 with cash"", to ""we are backed by cash and cash equivalents"". Of course this was swept under the table quickly in wild wild west cryptoverse.

Since January 2020, Tether's market cap (and distributions) has exploded from just $4+ Billion to now over $62+ Billion. Supposedly all safely backed by some form of financial reserve.

After the NYAG situation, earlier this year Tether was forced to finally publicly disclose their reserve composition. Although they didn't reveal much, the Microsoft Word-quality pie chart they posted did confirm that in fact just a fraction of their holdings is actual cash...the vast majority being held in ""Commercial Paper.""

What's commercial paper? It's short-term (unsecured) debt issued by companies. They're typically used to raise money for short term funding needs like buying inventory, payroll, or pre-paying construction vendors‚Ä¶.kind of like an ""IOU"" of the corporate world. It usually gets a rating, and is usually pretty safe...so long as the companies issuing it remain solvent.

As of the latest Attestation by their sketch accountant shows Tether holds just $6.2 Billion in cash, $30.8 Billion in commercial paper, the rest T-Bills and RRPs. [https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether\_assuranceconsolidated\_reserves\_report\_2021-06-30.pdf](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf)  

With it now in the open that these coins are actually operating more like unregulated money market funds, over the last several months alone the SEC, CFTC, DOJ, congressional financial committees, and the US Treasury department all set their sights on cracking down on stablecoins.

Furthermore, since Commercial Paper is traded at a discount to Face Value, Tether can buy up dog shit junk bonds for pennys on the dollar, but report it as the full maturity amounts on their balance sheet. Great for their balance sheet‚Ä¶horrible if there‚Äôs a run on Tether redemptions. 

A lot of moonbois and Crypto maxis tried to shrug all of this off, saying ""STFU FUDbois, who cares? They have a fractional reserve, regular banks do the same shit.""

This is true, except traditional banks are not gambling most of it in dog shit debt (at least hopefully not to the degree they pre-2008). Money market funds are pretty transparent with what they're invested in. And overall like them or not traditional banks are FDIC insured, meaning your funds are actually ""safu"" in the event of a run. 

Problem with Tether is that to this day, they still refuse to disclose the makeup of their commercial paper. Furthermore, at Tether's size they would be one of the biggest investors in the entire commercial paper market. However major players in the US investment markets claim they've never even heard of them. https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a

So this has all lead to speculation that maybe their paper is in fact Chinese paper. Why does this matter? 

Over the last 2 years, Chinese property developers have been issuing debt like crazy. So much so that the Chinese government has recently begun to significantly crack down on it, fearing a thread to their entire financial system. The biggest culprit is a company called Evergrande, who has run up a tab of over $300 Billion in debt, and is at risk of default any day. Trading of their bonds were halted last week. https://gulfnews.com/business/property/chinas-evergrandes-moment-of-truth-arrives-as-bond-payment-deadlines-loom-1.82361403

As Tether's huge influx of insurances coincided with the Chinese property development debt surge, many began to speculate that Tether's holdings could in fact be Evergrande debt. 

Pressure on Tether regarding their reserves continued to mount until finally several weeks ago they released an attestation containing the supposed ratings of their paper holdings. They basically said ""Don't worry, all of our paper is rated A2 and above.""

Exoneration? Not really. Remember that scene in the Big Short when Steve Carell's character was going to the bond rating agencies only to find out that it was all a big pay-to-play scheme. The agencies gave pretty much everybody a high rating regardless of actual risk. Well...its the same thing in China. https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/understanding-chinas-bond-ratings/ It's all pay to play, everyone is given a high ratings, and the ratings don't really mean shit.

Case in point, Evergrande's rating was AA up until just a few days ago. https://www.barrons.com/articles/evergrande-suspends-trading-of-onshore-corporate-bonds-after-downgrade-51631786843

Basically, Chinese commercial paper is the equivalent of mortgage backed securities circa 2007. 

As pressure continued to build, and with regulators circling them like hawks, last week Tether finally made a public statement claiming they do not hold any Evergrande debt. They said ‚ÄúTether does not hold any commercial paper or other debt or securities issued by Evergrande and has never done so,‚Äù But, they never said it wasn't Chinese paper at all.

Then just yesterday, Stuart Hoagner, Tether's lawyer put out a tweet saying.  "" If the concern is Evergrande, see our earlier statement. If the concern is Chinese CP, as such, we have published the ratings on our portfolio...""

This is essentially lawyer speak for ""We do hold Chinese paper, but don't worry because it has super good ratings"". 

So Tether is pretty much confirmed at least some or all of its paper reserves is Chinese. And if that's true, a good portion of it is probably dog shit debt right now. It does not matter if the debt is Evergrande, if the worst case scenario happens, and Evergrande defaults, the effects will be systemic throughout Chinese capital markets. The entire Chinese market will seize up. 

This event would cause the value of Tether's reserve holdings to plummet with it. If that happens, either the coin becomes unbacked, or they're forced to suck liquidity out of the market (burning coins). This is catastrophic for USDT and for crypto in general.

If Tether goes down, USDC or any other stablecoin will not have nearly enough liquidity to bail it out.  This is the Lehman-brothers gray rhino event of the crypto world.

 This is not FUD, this is a real situation you should pay attention to.
 
**TL;DR** Tether's lawyer basically confirmed they're holding a Chinese commercial paper time bomb. If Evergrande goes down, so will Tether's holdings."|1632071822.0

It is a large, physical coin with a private key etched into the back and the public key taped over said private key.

I won't link to the actual product so as to not give them any more direct traffic, but here are some pics: [One](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91TteCsW4vL._AC_SX466_.jpg) and [Two](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ee3nA+QKL._AC_SX466_.jpg).

This is a terrible idea for one major reason. The fact that it comes with the private key already etched in, means that the manufacturing facility very likely knows these private keys and can access the funds that its customers decide to store on these ""cold wallets"" at any time they choose.

Even if for some reason you trust the manufacturer (and you shouldn't), any individual employee working at the facility that has access to these coins before they are package (or access to the data used for the etching) could record the keys.

Also, while we are on the topic, do NOT purchase even reputable hardware wallets such as Ledger or Trezor from Amazon. Purchase direct from the manufacturer ONLY. Since anyone can sell on Amazon, you cannot trust that the reseller has not tampered with the device before sending it off to the Amazon warehouse.

23|I am running an Algorand participation node and here is why you should, too!|76|prjdf5|CryptoCurrency|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/prjdf5/i_am_running_an_algorand_participation_node_and/|65|"Hey y'all!So I recently followed [this tutorial](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/p9dv17/guide_algorand_participation_node_using_a/), and seamlessly implemented a participation node on the Algorand network! According to [https://metrics.algorand.org/](https://metrics.algorand.org/), there are currently a bit over 1.3k of us running active participation nodes. Folks, that's 1.3k accounts out of almost 7.9billion people. We're a rare breed, but an important one. And you should consider joining us! If you hold ALGO, you should consider this an investment! I am not affiliated with the Algorand foundation whatsoever. In fact, I can assure you that if I can do this- so can you.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tdd9wlacsjo71.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1820397def8a286d23374e8b9e25737c1a73db8

Setting up a participation node means your participating account becomes part of a pool ensuring the security and validity of the decentralized aspect of the Algorand network. ToKenOmIcS. Am I right? No, I am not. Not only is accelerated vesting nearly coming to an end as you may find in some recent posts on this sub, but governance is about to kick in. What does that all mean? It means the centralized agency (Algorand foundation) is allocating the last of a truck load of coins to their earliest investors, and putting the future of Algorand in OUR hands.

Now I know many of you are anxiously awaiting governance. Many are staked on Yieldly for the time being.. but I wanted to make sure this community understands what it means to have funds on an account linked to a participation node. Unfortunately I am certainly no expert, so this will be very basic. Again, just a person, like you. If anyone with more knowledge feels inclined to do so- please mention some of your thoughts below!

TL;DR**The account that is linked to the Algorand participation node is eligible for both staking in governance AND partaking in network participation.** That's right- you can partake in governance with the same account connected to your node. Thereby helping to protect your assets, protecting your comrade's assets, voting on governance proposals, and accumulating those sweet ALGO rewards.... all at the same time.

So if you're looking for the full Algorand experience and plan on staking your algo to partake in the (exciting) upcoming governance protocols, consider starting up a node and helping to protect your governance-staked assets by providing the network with added security. The more node-runners there are, the more secure the network is, the safer your asset is. Why? Simply put, there is power in numbers on the algorand blockchain!

By shopping patiently, I was able to buy ALL materials needed for this for \~$150USD. I simply skipped my biweekly ALGO DCA. Although there are currently no financial rewards for running a node (other than protecting you and your comrade's assets), governance may (or very well may not) change that.

I should add that the higher the balance of the account linked to the participation node, the more chance it will be chosen to participate on the blockchain. I've got about A100 in my account at the moment. According to the previously mentioned metrics site, The account with the lowest balance that has participated in voting held a balance of A2. A small price to pay to help support the security of your own bags, I'd say! Of course, I am planning on adding my entire bag of algo to this node account, and will be partaking in governance at the same time.

Y'algo and have a great night, now!

But the real reason why I wanted to warn people is following.

Only in 2021, there have been 14 recorded physical attacks on cryptocurrency holders. Sure that may sound low compared to cash robberies and such. 

Just to list a few recently recoded incidents involving crypto:

* March 18  [Armed robbers steal iPhone, $5k at gunpoint](https://archive.is/DpOQe) 
* April 13  [Armed men assault home in Canada and steal crypto keys ](https://archive.is/GP76C)
* June 14  [a trader was temporary blinded meanwhile HK 2$ Mil was stolen from him.](https://archive.is/CeCA8)
* July 1 [Bitcoin holder drugged and robbed by Tinder date](https://archive.is/uIMAl) 
* August 8 [Crypto trader who bragged on social networks murdered](https://archive.is/2kfpq)

&#x200B;

Most people who aren't familiar with cryptocurrencies think that if someone owns some crypto they are apparently rich. All they hear is the news about the price of Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum. This can make some desperate, greedy or simply evil people do very nasty things. Some people are willing to do crazy things to get money. This is not FUD on crypto, not even closely. It's just an advice to keep your investments to yourself, no matter how small.

I'm afraid that such incidents will get much more frequent every day with the mass adoption. It's smart to be vigilant. It's not a weakness or social disability or whatever people think it is, it's your strength and your safety measure.
