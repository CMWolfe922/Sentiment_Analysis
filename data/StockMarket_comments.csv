4|Teetering property developer Evergrande sparks contagion fears for China's economy. Company with $300 billion US debt load poised to miss key interest payment Monday|26|prky03|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/prky03/teetering_property_developer_evergrande_sparks/|13|"Property developer China Evergrande Group is teetering on the brink of collapse, weighed down by a giant debt load and billions of dollars in real estate it can't sell as quickly or as profitably as anticipated.

While trouble has been brewing for a year, it's coming to a head now, as the conglomerate missed one loan payment in June and more are expected. Evergrande's offices were the site of angry protests this week, and things could get even uglier on Monday when the company is likely to miss another key interest payment to its increasingly concerned financiers.

Evergrande's possible collapse is sparking fears that it could take other parts of China's housing market down with it — and impact business interests outside China, too.

## What is Evergrande?

Founded in 1996 in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, Evergrande is mostly a property developer whose core business is buying up land and turning it into residential real estate. Company founder Hui Ka Yan is a former steel worker who rode China's 21st-century real estate boom to a fortune that was at one point last year worth $30 billion US, good enough for the title of third-richest man in China. 

The company has built more than 1,300 housing developments in 280 cities in China, with plans for another 3,000 projects underway in various cities across the country.

But like any good conglomerate, it has expanded into all sort of other businesses, including [bottled water and food](https://mobilesite.evergrande.com/en/business.aspx?tags=16), electric vehicles, theme parks, a Netflix-like streaming service with almost 40 million customers — and even a [professional soccer team](https://gzfc.evergrande.com/english/about.aspx).

## Why is it in trouble?

>Debt — and lots of it. The company has almost two trillion yuan of debt on its books, the equivalent of more than $300 billion US. The company aggressively borrowed money to buy more land to develop, and sold apartments quickly at low margins to raise enough cash to start the cycle again — which works fine as a business model, until it doesn't.

In late 2020, new rules that brought more scrutiny to the company's finances revealed higher-than-expected debt loads. That, coupled with mounting construction delays, spooked buyers, setting up a vicious cycle. The company began its descent to pariah status as lenders and buyers lost their nerve in lockstep with each other.

Every attempt by Evergrande since then to distract from its problems only served to draw more attention to them. Lenders became more and more unsettled. Existing owners got upset. New sales slowed, which created a feedback loop that got lenders even more jittery.

## What could happen?

A number of bleak B words are on the table — bankruptcy, breakup, buyout or bailout — and none of them are ideal.

## Is there an impact outside China?

Not much, directly, although Evergrande does have assets in Europe and North America — [including the ritzy Château Montebello resort in Quebec](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ch%C3%A2teau-montebello-resort-bought-by-chinese-real-estate-group-1.2878002) — but the company's woes are nonetheless a cautionary tale for people everywhere.

5|The Man Who Lost $20 Billion: Bill Hwang from Archegos?|28|prk8wr|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/prk8wr/the_man_who_lost_20_billion_bill_hwang_from/|7|"The Man Who Lost $20 Billion in Two Days Is Lying Low in New Jersey

About 15 miles from midtown Manhattan, the head of Archegos is groping for answers in the wake of one of the biggest debacles in Wall Street history.

He sits on the porch in a white plastic chair, a swing set out back, the lawn freshly mowed.

Here in suburban Tenafly, 15 miles from midtown Manhattan, few would guess that this unassuming figure is none other than Bill Hwang — the man who just lost more than $20 billion.

“Billion with a B?” gasps a neighbor down the block, when told of the epic blowup at Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management.

Yes, billion, with a B, as shocked lenders can attest. Four months after Archegos rocked global finance, bankers and federal authorities are still sifting through the wreckage. The liquidator who mopped up after Lehman Brothers has now come for Archegos. Some colleagues have turned on Hwang; others hope he’ll bankroll hedge funds that might yet rise from the ashes.

U.S. prosecutors are asking questions, too, including the big one: Was all of this another spectacle of Wall Street greed and hubris, or was it something worse? Credit Suisse Group AG, staggered by a $5.5 billion blow, says it was likely deceived by Hwang’s family office.

Hwang is groping for answers of his own. He amassed one of the world’s great fortunes in virtual secrecy — and then lost it, very publicly, in a blink. In the easeful heat of this summer morning, he’s awaiting a call with a retired U.S. general who, he hopes, might provide some counsel. He’s dressed like your average American soccer dad: teal shirt, blue cargo pants, Adidas slides. He has a pad of paper and a pen handy. An 8-ounce plastic bottle of Poland Spring water stands on the white plastic table which, like the chair, could have come from Costco.

At hand, too, is a Christian pamphlet — a testament to the faith that’s guided Hwang as he made dangerous bets in the markets and was even charged with insider trading in the past. The title is Armor of God, a reference to Ephesians 6:11 — “Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes.”

Hwang is relaxed, self-deprecating and reflective in a brief conversation, but declines to discuss the Archegos fiasco or his next steps. He’s been lying low here in New Jersey, in this tidy borough of 15,000, beyond The Palisades cliffs that rise above the Hudson River. He is not exactly a Wall Street Napoleon exiled to Elba: Hwang has lived here for years, in the same house, with cobwebs in the eaves and hedges out front. A Mercedes sits in the driveway. “Black Lives Matter” signs dot neighbors’ manicured lawns. Homes on this tree-softened street tend to sell for a few million dollars — a modest price, for a billionaire.

It’s difficult to square Hwang’s mostly unglamorous life here with the portrait of him that has emerged over the past few months. By all accounts he eschews the trappings of extravagant wealth. At the Tenafly Classic Diner, where the “NJ Sandwich” goes for $6.95, the servers say he’s been known to stop by, but haven’t seen him lately. More recently he’s been chauffeuring his family around town, in between coping with one of the biggest debacles in Wall Street history.

Credit Suisse provided the first official peek into the flameout. A 172-page autopsy, released publicly on July 29, exposed a litany of management failures at Credit Suisse. But the embattled lender also says “it seems likely that Archegos deceived CS and obfuscated the true extent of its positions, which Archegos amassed in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic.”

This account also hints at a shift in Hwang’s strategy that has baffled outsiders. Archegos had grown rapidly by making huge bets on established FAANG stocks — blue-chip U.S. technology companies. But by last year, it was plowing money into risker bets like ViacomCBS and several U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, some of which had been targeted by short sellers.

When the banks began dumping Hwang’s portfolio, these shares tumbled. And a more recent crackdown by the Chinese government has further decimated many of Hwang’s favored bets.

For Hwang’s family office, now comes the inevitable: liquidation. Only months ago, it boasted holdings — built on borrowed money — valued at more than $120 billion. Today, everyone is lining up for the scraps.

The person handling the liquidation is David Pauker, the specialist who stepped in after Lehman failed during the 2008 financial crisis. More recently Pauker worked on the restructuring of Steinhoff International Holdings, the South African furniture retailer that nearly collapsed after an accounting scandal in 2017. He declined to comment on pending matters.

Across the river from Tenafly, at Hwang’s midtown Manhattan office, his landlord is suing Archegos for unpaid rent. Like building owners citywide, real-estate giant Vornado Realty Trust — run by billionaire Steven Roth — has been stung by the pandemic. It’s trying to recoup $159,165.55 from Archegos.

Hwang’s 38th-floor offices in the building across from Carnegie Hall have mostly been emptied, and his Christian charity, the Grace and Mercy Foundation, has decamped to a cheaper 22nd floor in the same building. The foundation had more than $600 million in assets as of 2019, according to its most recent tax filings. It had even more money in early 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The size of Bill Hwang’s fortune remains uncertain. Former employees have been grousing that while they’ve been wiped out, Hwang, through private investments and other holdings away from Archegos, could still be a billionaire.

One such investment was the seed money he poured into four of Cathie Wood’s exchange traded funds that have exploded in popularity thanks to their market-beating returns.

Banks are haggling with Hwang’s team to figure out the size of his remaining wealth and whether they can claw back any of it. Credit Suisse has said it will seek to recoup money from Archegos and its related entities and individuals. The Swiss bank also flagged in its findings that Hwang’s firm took out more than $2 billion in excess margin from its account with the lender in the days before the collapse.

The Department of Justice has been moving ahead with a probe into the blowup. At least one line of questioning has revolved around the communication between Hwang’s top associate Andy Mills and the lenders, and whether he may have misled them in the week of the crash, according to a person interviewed by prosecutors.

“The assertion that Andy Mills or anyone at Archegos misled the banks during the week of March 22 is untrue in every respect,” a spokesman for Archegos said.

The Archegos debacle has fractured ties between Hwang and some former colleagues, who are fighting to recoup deferred compensation that was tied up with the firm. Part of their annual bonuses — which amounted to about $50 million — was invested alongside Hwang and rocketed in value with his portfolio, people familiar with the matter said. They want Hwang to carve out cash from money he may have set aside elsewhere.

One of Archegos’s employees has put his home in Manhattan and another on Long Island up for sale, according to real-estate listings.

Despite everything, Hwang is trying to push forward. He’s investing his remaining money, and occasionally crossing the Hudson to catch dinner at a New York restaurant. He spends spare hours as he has for much of his adult life: praying, reading Christian-themed literature, and listening to recordings of the Bible. He’s recently been reading “The Screwtape Letters” by C.S. Lewis, looking for guidance to navigating the current troubles. A satirical epistolary novel, the book features the demon Screwtape writing letters of advice to his nephew, Wormwood, who is trying to win the soul of a young man.

Others are trying to move on too. Hwang has promised to throw his weight, if not his money, behind at least three funds being launched by protégés. Hwang named his firm Archegos, an ancient Greek word for leader or author, a reference to Jesus. The names of two of the new funds reflect the cataclysm at Archegos. One is Red Ember Capital and the other is AriseN Partners."|1632098889.0

7|No China bailouts and big volatility shock in US markets?|20|prhrsv|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/prhrsv/no_china_bailouts_and_big_volatility_shock_in_us/|2|" 

Been reading through some really interesting thoughts on Twitter posted in previous threads about Evergrande. If these guys turn out to have a point, this would all seem to be coming together.

First let me disclaimer with I've not fact checked this. I assume these guys know a lot more than me  I'm posting it here to let others know, offer my simplified TLDR of the main points and if anyone wants to post counter-arguments to their points you're welcome to.

**Concept One**

[Girolamo Pandolfi da Casio ditto Carlo Dossi Erba on Twitter: ""Evergrande: why most analysis is dead in water and how best to understand and navigate what’s happening? Both denialists and alarmists are getting it wrong. Let’s start by understanding this: what is happening is the result of a CCP-initiated policy change to curb leverage. 1/N"" / Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/INArteCarloDoss/status/1438944431734919175?s=19)

There'll be no bail outs. What's happening in China is not an ""Oops"". The Chinese RE market has been subject to all sorts of fuckery going on on it for a long time and has become a large percentage of the GDP. Companies like Evergrande are on the verge of going bust even although they're not reported a single loss, ever. This is because losses have been hidden on balance sheets as assets in the form the properties - but these properties can not be sold, in reality these companies hold nothing but liabilities.

The CCP have noticed this and they've set out rules to stop this for becoming an uncontrollable explosion somewhere down the line. Dictated leverage caps and various other things that are going to curb the growth of this industry (Stop the bubble). This is not Lehmen-esk in that a surprise happened and the question becomes what will the response be - this is a result of something the CCP has already done.

China can not and will not bail out Evergrande because it has recognised that an uncontrollable bust will come later down the line if they do not engineer a controlled one now. China may backstop housing prices to prevent losses to investors, but they will let the overleveraged and under-capitalised companies fail. Allowing for a strong base to be left of those who succeed.

**Concept 2**

[TheLastBearStanding on Twitter: ""🚨🚨 China Credit - Writing on the Wall - and How to Trade It. (9/15/21)👇👇"" / Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1438171695685283847)

This thing of having on-paper ""Assets"" of trillions of dollars that are really worthless is not contained to Evergrande. It's a broad issues across the Chinese market. The Chinese market is hugely overleveraged and all of the perceived value of the industry is mainly down to sly tricks and creative accounting - not real growth, and certainly not functional demand. Most of the properties are empty.

What we're seeing in Evergrane now is just a glimpse into what we're due to see in other RE companies.

**Concept 3**

[TheLastBearStanding on Twitter: ""🚨🚨 Equities, Options Gravity, and Volatility: The Fragile Market Hypothesis 🚨🚨👇👇 (Aka one doofus's overly simplistic attempt to explain lurking risk in the market with stick figures and clip art. If you're invested, you should read)"" / Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1424833306781159433)

An event like this in China can create a volatility shock in US markets. Causing prices to move faster, faster moving prices causing more hedging against deep OTM put options and this having a self-reinforcing effect causing capitulation risk in the US markets. This sequence of events would build up to a Black Swan event."|1632089700.0
8|$ATER TECHNICAL STRATEGY FOR WEEK 9-20|8|prkm8m|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/prkm8m/ater_technical_strategy_for_week_920/|3|"This is my strategy for $ATER going into the week.

[9\/20 WEEK PLAN](https://preview.redd.it/dore8mn96ko71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=dec1301b54976b85c8a19505b28bbc69168872c9)

Here are the strengths that supports this plan:

1. Support at 9.00 – 9.14 held beautifully with a **RETEST**
2. EMA10 was RECLAIMED, which $ATER has **RESPECTED EMA10 SINCE 8/31**
3. **Rebound off EMA21 with Oops Reversal** (buyers bought back in after realizing they’re stops were hit BELOW EMA10, touched EMA21 for shake out)
4. **Bullish outside bar** that covers **2 prior candles**

**I SAID BEFORE THAT REPSPECTING EMA10** **IS A SIGN OF A MOTHER STOCK.** **THE BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED ABOVE IS WHAT A MONSTER STOCK DOES !!**

Bears printed a MOTHER BAR that, once broken, will trigger the next MONSTER RUN. After the resistance is broken, the next target is the all time high (ATH) at 19.10 which is not too extended for Bulls to take out. Volume has been acting well and there has been more accumulation volume than distribution. Volume also increased on bull runs and dries up on the pullback (a sign of consolidation). Holders not selling, which can be seen by below average volume.

Let review what MOTHER BARS are and why they are important:

**Mother bars** are candles with a wide range and above average volume. Above average volume is needed to ""strengthen"" the move. The wider the range, the more difficult to break the highs and lows.

Shorts must break the lows to signal those waiting on the sidelines that price will drop and the momentum from **""new shorts"" entering the trade** will decrease the price.

Likewise, a break above the highs of these bars is a signal for **""new bulls"" waiting to enter** and those entering the trade will drive momentum and price upwards.

The closer the targets, whether long or short, the **easier the momentum** for price to go in a direction.

As always, we want to **check continuity**, which both the monthly and weekly shows being **upward**:

[MONTHLY CONTINUITY](https://preview.redd.it/2cw0nyzc6ko71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=179a10507053d9ac784d9da95e950bbe20a367c7)

[WEEKLY CONTINUITY](https://preview.redd.it/lh9zcazd6ko71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6dcc4d8f238acbd076e7f4533ab3da7cdc7bc4b)

What I’ll be watching for is the break of the mother bar for **HUGE** momentum. Again, there are strengths that support this move:

1. **Support was confirmed**
2. **EMA10 was reclaimed**
3. **Respect EMA10 is a monster characteristic**, which $ATER has shown since 08/31
4. **Bullish outside bar** printed after the **inside bar (indecision)** shows that direction is **UP**
5. **Oops Reversal below EMA10 and rebound off EMA21**

[SUPPORT](https://preview.redd.it/z56xc4sf6ko71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7a16c81897797e50ad4a14ed7026b345d8b2a96)

[OOPS REVERSAL](https://preview.redd.it/ae4ulcjg6ko71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=6468b1c947c75c539515720f52d84b7449a3c0d0)

Remember that breaking the high of the prior bar will signal **“new bulls”** to enter.  Nevertheless, we have to think in terms of **probabilities and examine risks**. Will the support be tested again? Maybe…But there is evidence indicating a low likelihood:

1. Shorts are **fighting against continuity**
2. The pullback to 9.14 could not break consolidation **support** 9.00.
3. There was a dry up volume and below average volume, which shows players are **not willing to sell**.
4. **Support was tested** and the day finished a **bullish outside bar** that closed above the prior high.
5. There an expectation with continued uptrend with **Oops Reversal**

Shorts / profit takers have to remember that an attempt at break support and EMA10 had **ALREADY FAILED**. What is the likelihood of success the 2nd try? The 1st attempted ended in an outside bar closing above the prior high. This **outside bar has a bigger range** as well, **covering both candles.** Holders are not selling neither (shown by the low volume) so where will the short momentum come from?

All signs point to Bulls having the advantage.

Let’s take a look at targets. It will not be an easy task for bulls neither b/c volume is needed to break the Bear Mother Bar. Will volume show? The **continuity is UP**. There is a potential as there are signs of **strength**. Past volume has been monstrous. If volume does show, the targets are:

1. Last candle high 11.97 will be a signal for “new bulls” to enter the trade and momentum will build.
2. Bear mother bar high 16.68 is next.
3. Last week’s high 19.10 is very close.
4. 21.07 is last month’s high.

[9\/20 WEEK PLAN](https://preview.redd.it/fc2rhqqi6ko71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2aa8bf84fb25ef4c949155e6c1455fb291a6c75)

Breaking the highs of longer timeframes are stronger signals as they are typically harder to break. Why? Longer timeframes reduces volatility and shows the trend direction. Thus, **breaking a high on a longer timeframe triggers a stronger signal because it validates the trend.**

Notice that 22.19 is both a prior weekly and monthly high. Taking out 2 highs in 1 break will trigger a MASSIVE run. How big? We will have to see!

Also, I get a lot of question about indicators. There is not one indicator that will predict movement. ALL INDICATORS ARE LAGGING. Indicators have information only AFTER a move is complete. This is why it’s so important to examine the behavior of a stock and think in terms of probabilities.

**APPLY THE TECHNIQUE DISCUSSED !!**

We know that continuity is up and the bear mother bar high will be broken (yes, will be, shorts / profit takers already failed).  Break the daily chart down to timeframes you feel comfortable, which I'm using the 30min.  This way, you'll be able to see the different levels going into this.

[30 MIN](https://preview.redd.it/1t3ak87k6ko71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac36241b62d56c0d0fa6cd9737d7a20d78a6623d)

9|Why I bought the dip on Berkeley Lights after that horrendous short report|2|prpplg|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/prpplg/why_i_bought_the_dip_on_berkeley_lights_after/|3|"Disclosure: I recently opened a position in Berkeley Lights after that BS short 

Berkeley Lights operates a hi tech platform that separates cells that previously had to be analyzed and separated one at a time. The Beacon system is said to save upwards of two or three months in development for drug manufacturers, synthetic biology or any other company that needs to sort through large number of cells. This company was recently smeared with a nonsensical juvenile and stupid short report. Here I am focusing most on that report. 

The short report written by Scorpion Capital is a disgrace, before publishing it they released a series of tweets that sent the stock spiraling down. Using language like dumpster fire, fraud etc to attract attention very juvenile. I’m going to start with what they got wrong, and then what they got right, doing this because I want to expand on what they got wrong and if it’s correctable. 
So what they got wrong 
All of their customers are unhappy with the product and these companies were fleeced the thinking being that since these big pharma companies have so much cash they didn’t do any due diligence before hand. 
The claim itself is strange that Scorpion Capital without any expertise in genomics would be able to uncover something that these tech companies couldn’t have, and a lot of cash also means they are best positioned to be able to do the research and have the best access to outside experts as well. The idea that large successful companies don’t do any research and just purchase things without verification, that’s what failing companies do.  
Second ,we have some counter evidence. Two of the companies listed in the report said to have tried to return the equipment or to have not used it because it was either inefficient or too complicated to use have signed multi- year agreements with them recently. Those being Bayer and Thermo Fischer. Bayer being the company that tried two send it back of course that is just what “allegedly” happened, and we know now that is bs. 
So to believe the report you would have to believe that after first being fleeced the first time the company would then make the same error again but this time upping the agreement, but Scorpion Capital has uncovered something that they have no expertise that the best financed large companies could not. That is an awfully arrogant stance to have and a foolish one 
Analysts have also come out since then and refuted that, saying that they talked to four of their customers that said that it made them more efficient and saved time. Contradicting what was said by Scorpion capital. People are with good reason distrustful of analysts, but we have more transparency now than ever and sites like Tipranks tracks analysts accuracy. So we have one analyst coming out with a buy rating and another reaffirming a prior buy rating. First we have Doug Schenkel with a success rate of 71% with an average return of 33% with a buy rating after the report, and then we have Mark Massaro from BTIG covering the stock as well who reaffirmed his buy rating with a price target of $65 and his success rate is 62% with 24% accuracy. Both of these cover analysts cover life sciences and are considered five star analysts based on their success rate.  
Within the last month you have 3 buys and one hold. The one hold is from a 3 and a half star analyst with a 63% successful rating, but with only 40 calls made lacks experience as the other two I mentioned have well north of 200 calls made. He also called it a hold, but had a price target of $66 which is well over 100% upside. 
We also had Daniel Arias with a buy rating with a price target of 61 . Arias has a 77% accuracy thus with 86 calls with 66 of those being correct.  
 
 
Based on the 5 wall street analysts covering the stock over the stock over the past 12 months we have a 64-dollar price target representing a 136% upside from the current value. So, we put this up against Scorpion capital and they are once again saying that they have uncovered something that some of the best most accurate analysts and the largest Pharma companies could not. It’s an absurd ask. 

 
That gets me to my next point which I’m not going to detail every error, but it’s the most embarrassing part. This report is full of hearsay, false or misleading information and complaints that are from  from 2 to 3 years ago 
	Here is one example that is misleading and stupid. They show a headline featuring Zymergen and a huge decline in share price after CEO steps down. They are inferring here that BLI is a synthetic bio company which they are not, the machine can work with synthetic biology companies, it provides an instrument that can work with any cell-based company. It’s silly and stupid. Either they are too dumb to know the difference or they think the readers will be too dumb to know. It is deceitful either way, out of ignorance or more likely out of greed for their short position and the lack of factual evidence.  
 
They include in here like asking an anonymous person at Gingko whether they would invest in the company, and present that as evidence. The thing is they didn’t even report them as saying no.  
Leading us to wonder… I wonder what side they fell on.  
This is not research, it does not amount to anything concrete, and when someone is quoted something that is not negative, they frame it in that light. Interpreting people's responses in how they see fit. 
 

 
What they got right… Well, that is the obvious answer here it is the financials, and the complexity of the system, and the cost. They have a terrible EV/sale.  
The complexity of the system increases the learning curve to using it. I’m sure that all of you have had an experience at work where you were told that you needed to learn a new platform or tool, and there was a promise of this making you more productive more efficient. Except you were not more productive or more efficient right away. You were less efficient and less productive while you're learning how to operate the new system and then over time you're more efficient. The longer the learning curve the more time you are less efficient than you were when you were not using it, and that is likely to generate tremendous frustration. So that is on the company to make the software and system easier to use, simplify it.  
 
Second point- The financials. The revenue growth year over year for the quarter 2 was 82% and 56% increase over for the first half of year compared to 2020. The big revenue growth can be misleading given their poor performance in 2020. Some of this can be attributed to Covid and the reluctance of companies to invest in expensive capital during a pandemic, and the rest appears to be a mixture of poor execution and a very narrow revenue stream consisting solely of hardware sales for their instrument Beacon. They did develop some new use cases working with Bayer in crop science. They are committed to a 90 to 100 million end of year sales. I must mention Seeking Alpha has a quant system which is an algorithm that chooses stocks based on fundamentals and the company performs horribly and we can see why, it is expensive, it’s unprofitable, the return on common equity is negative 149% which is terrible. You hope they can differentiate and have more a diverse set of income streams. Fair point made, and a major weakness, and risk 
 
 
Third point that is valid is the beacon is expensive coming in at 2 million dollars. This means that at times of uncertainty you cut high capital costs like the Beacon. It is also priced out of the market for small and medium biotech companies. Large pharma like Pfizer do much less basic or fundamental research and instead purchase once that has been done, and there is less risk involved. The FDA process is tough, and you can derisk by buying after the potential medicine has been tested in early trials. You can pick the winners. Or you can sign a partnership like Pfizer did with BioNtech. So, who would benefit most from your product, and who could significantly decrease your reliance on large pharmaceutical companies is using a different strategy like a subscription service, or an equity deal or royalties which would be interesting. So I hope we get some more creativity to lower the upfront cost of Beacon so it’s more accessible.  
 
 
So that is it, what do I think of Berkeley Lights… 
Well, they offer a unique product without direct competition. When it has been implemented and the user is fluent in using it, it is a serious time saver. The short report makes relevant points about the financials, and the fact it was already going down, and their financials were poor, they had cover to write a very sloppy short report. I bought in at $20 would not buy over 20, and will keep it a limited part of my portfolio. It is a speculative high risk high reward. I also despise shorts

10|How to Play the Current Market Drop|16|prdyem|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/prdyem/how_to_play_the_current_market_drop/|46|"Several times this year **SPY** has broken through the lower end of its' upward sloping channel.  On 1/29, 3/4, 6/18, 7/19 the price fell below the SMA 50 on the daily chart, and closed below it.

Each time **SPY** bounced back the following day, reestablishing the 50 as a major line of support for the ETF.  After the next day closed above support, the market continued on to establish a new ATH.

Will that happen on Monday?  We will soon find out, but I certainly hope it doesn't.

If **SPY** continues to drop, it will be the first time this year that a break of major support had continuation.  At that point, 436 and 431.78 become the next two targets for a major breach.

Either way - *do not anticipate a move, wait for confirmation before acting on it.* In other words, don't start buying *calls* or going long on **/ES** futures thinking you can predict a bottom.  You can't.  It will become clear when **SPY** has established support and it's ready to rebound.

Here's what you should be doing though - making your list of stocks that are gaining strength ahead of **SPY**.  Stocks like **UPST, ETSY,** and **DASH** have all been pushing upwards during this market decline.   The next list should be of stocks that that are currently holding major support areas (**MSFT, FB,** and **AMZN** for example) - these stocks have been dragged down by a bearish market trend, but also have been able to hold support (unlike **AAPL** which broke through).

When **SPY** finally does finds support, this is your opportunity for some high probability trades.  An opportunity you do not want to waste by trying to get ahead of it.

This means that the first thing you will need to do is, *be patient*.  This is much harder to do than it sounds of course.  You'll see **SPY** bouncing back up and watching the stocks on your list bounce up with it.  At this point you might think, ""I am missing it, I need to get in now!"".  *No you don't*.  Wait.  Make sure the market isn't just chopping around, and then getting ready for another leg down. Much like it did from Monday - Thursday of last week.

When the market finally begins to reverse it will be clear - and it is at this point you want to start putting on Put Credit Spreads, Call Debit Spreads, Straight Calls, and Long Stock among those tickers you have been watching.  For example - let's say the market continues to drop and heads down to 431 (SMA 100), where it stabilizes and then begins to bounce back upwards.  At the same point you notice that **AMZN** is resting on it's SMA 100 around 3400.  As the market starts to go back up, so will **AMZN**, most likely recapturing its SMA 50 (3450).  You could do a Put Credit Spread of 3395/3390 for 3 weeks out and probably get a credit of roughly $1.50 for it, which is a 43% ROI.  You'll have two major lines of support above your short strike, giving you a lot of cushion on this trade.  You could also do a Call Debit Spread ATM of 3455/3460 for a debit under $2.50, as well.  Your risk is defined by your debit, which is less than 50% of the distance in the strike prices.

Perhaps **MSFT** dropped down to $292, right on its SMA 50, and is also showing Relative Strength to **SPY** \- if so you can do a one month out ITM calls with a delta of .7 or higher (probably a strike around $270).

Make sure you aren't too heavy into any single sector, and you have stocks like **MCD** and **AMAT** in your list as well.

What you want is to have several bullish plays ready to go across various sectors, and when you see **SPY** once again push upwards, you should be aggressively pulling the trigger on these trades.  *Again - not until you have confirmed that* ***SPY*** *has found support.*

Drops like these provide the best buying opportunities but so often people are either unprepared for them or jump in too early.  Last Thursday (9/16), I saw many traders assume that the drop was over given the previous pattern on **SPY** and as such they started executing a number of bullish swing trades, including Calls on **SPY**.  Needless to say, on Friday their accounts took a serious hit.  Why?  Because **SPY** did not confirm a reversal, just consolidation.

There are several areas of horizontal support/resistance for **SPY**,  downward sloping trendlines you can draw on the daily chart, and major SMA's to guide you - it should not be unclear to anyone when **SPY** reverses.  On Thursday, the market breached none of these lines - so there was no reason to get bullish on it.

Obviously these drops provide excellent Day Trading opportunities - on Friday for example, **ZM** began to go up around noon (est) as **SPY** continued to chop around, indicating Relative Strength to the market.  At 2pm (est), that strength is confirmed with **SPY** dropping and **ZM** holding its' bid.  That ticker provided several excellent *Day Trading* entries and exits throughout the day.  **UPST** and **ETSY** were similar.  In fact, days that **SPY** is bearish give you the best insight into stocks that are strong against the market and ready to really go once that get a tailwind behind them.

Many short-term traders shy away from price action like this on **SPY** and that would be a mistake.  *Day Trade* these drops with strong stocks, *Swing Trade* the reversal with high probability option plays.

\*Obviously you can and should *Day Trade* the reversal as well, but that is just a matter of looking for RS/RW as **SPY** is rebounding.

\*\*Also note that when I refer to Relative Strength I am not talking about RSI or Beta.  There are several posts on RS/RW in r/RealDayTrading and in my post history if you are curious.

TL;DR - These market drops provide the best *swing* and *day* trading opportunities, don't let them pass you by."|1632077519.0

12|Hyperfine (HCAQ) Deep Dive taking off after merger. Portable MRI FDA approved|1|prqa2g|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/prqa2g/hyperfine_hcaq_deep_dive_taking_off_after_merger/|2|"
Disclaimer: I have a small position in Hyperfine (HCAQ), and hope to add after the merger

Hyperfine a company that has developed the first portable MRI was founded by high profile serial med tech entrepreneur Dr. Jonathan Rothberg by way of the innovation incubator 4catalyzer. Dr. Rothberg has also brought Butterfly Networks (BFLY) and Quantum-Si (QSI) public as well through spac mergers. I love all three of these companies as well and have done dd on them and am invested.  
 
There are some similarities with Hyperfine and BFLY and QSI in that they leverage semiconductor technology to make processes more efficient. Butterfly Networks has some striking similarities to Hyperfine 
BFLY was the first SPAC to go public from Jonathan Rothberg, and is the most like Hyperfine. Butterfly Networks and Hyperfine are both disrupting existing industries and technologies. Butterfly and Hyperfine use semiconductor technology to miniaturize existing medical technology making it more portable, more efficient and at a lower cost. For butterfly, they have taken the ultrasound and shrunk it down to the size of an electric hand-held razor, and it is compatible with a cell phone (Cell phone screen or tablet acts as the monitor). It makes sense to first analyze Butterfly in terms of better understanding Hyperfine, as Butterfly is a more mature product and it provides insights into how Hypefine may market and develop their MRI. 
Butterfly is an incredible technology for several reasons. First, you increase the accessibility of the ultrasound, right you can have it in family practitioners' office. So, this is an example of increased accessibility, having the ultrasound where you would not before. In that sense there is no competition, you must educate potential customers about the benefits of having an ultrasound in alternative environments. This is something that Hyperfine must do, as they are seeking to redefine the use cases.  Like self-monitoring on an ultrasound that is a new use case. Literally, having an ultrasound at home and communicating using telehealth with a doctor that lives on another continent. You could have this on a cruise ship, or a remote military base, you get the idea, ultrasounds will be where they have not before. 
 	They also have an ultrasound designed for veterinarians use, legacy expensive ultrasound machines work very well, however they have very predictable downsides that can be exploited and the industry can be disrupted. The legacy Ultrasound is large, and not very mobile. It is expensive, and requires extensive training to read and interpret. Butterrly is small, inexpensive, and portable. They also have software and cloud storage that helps with transferring and storing your data. 
 So brilliant and an exciting business opportunity as they start to collect data store it in the cloud and in time use machine learning that can help decipher the scan 
As far as the business model, of course you have the hardware, but that is sold close to cost, it is the the cloud service subscription fee, which we all now as SAAS or software as a service. Investors love the margins associated with SAAS. Butterfly has executed well also, unlike many other SPACs.  
Hyperfine conceptually is quite like Butterfly Networks, however this time it is the MRI. Of course, it is not handheld we are talking about an MRI, but it still is small enough to fit into an elevator and can be plugged into a normal socket, meaning it can be moved around a hospital and most importantly moved into an ICU. Or be stored within the ICU. We will start to see some of the similarities, but it starts with an analysis of what limitations do the current models have.  
Let us start by analyzing the legacy MRI machine. MRI machines can cost upwards of a million dollars and could require several hundreds of thousands more when you include the MRI Suite which needs to be built due to the extreme magnetic field which is generated which can be 60,000 times the strength of earth’s own magnetic field. Economics teaches to always look at the tradeoffs of any decision. We of course have the opportunity cost associated with the excessive cost of the equipment, but we also do with the space that is needed to house an MRI machine. This is significant space that could be used for other revenue generating activities. 
Well needlessly to say, the costs associated with building an MRI suite and purchasing the machine, are high. This makes it cost prohibitive for many hospitals reducing access to MRIs to the public. Fewer hospitals will have one, so if you could imagine a medium sized town would only have one MRI machine, and having only one hospital that has only one machine is a market failure, because in effect it is a monopoly, monopolies reduce consumer surplus, imagine the hospital can charge as high of a rate as they would like, and you will pay since there is not an alternative.  
Hyperfine is just a 50,000 upfront cost, an enormous difference and a great competitive advantage that could potentially increase the number of facilities offering MRI imaging thus bringing down costs for the consumer through increased competition. For the hospital, they have lower capital costs freeing up cash that can be invested elsewhere. The quality of the imaging of the larger machine remains better now, but we are talking access when you did not have access before. It could mean the difference between you not getting an MRI and choosing to get one.  
Now we can look at one of the other major disadvantages, and this is the lack of portability of the traditional MRI machine. The traditional MRI needs to be placed in a secure environment requiring the transport of each patient to that room which is not close to the ICU given what the needs of the MRI suite. First you have the danger of moving a patient in a critical state, both in the time it takes to transport, and the transport itself. It has been reported that adverse effects can happen anywhere between 22-46 percent of patients associated with transporting them to the MRI. The time saving measure as well as the reduction of risk in eliminating the transportation of the patient is huge. 
Now we can talk about labor productivity everybody's favorite topic, I am obviously insincere, it’s nobody's favorite topic. Let us look at the workflow associated with traditional MRI compared to the Hyperfine. You have 25.8 hours from when deciding that the patient needs an MRI until that whole procedure including analysis is finished. With the Hyperfine you have that done in just 90 minutes. That is a staggering 94% reduction in time. Of course, that is great for the patient. But as far a hospital administrator, that means less staff needed, or you open time for that staff to be doing other revenue generating activities. I love all the connections this company makes to simple economic concepts. 
The Hyperfine has already sold over 50 units, and is cleared by the FDA, which is a huge hurdle that every investor is aware of. It also means it that it has been studied extensively. The most impactful study of Hyperfine was done by Yale Health which found the hyperfine to be effective in identifying hemorrhage that would be life threatening. The accuracy y of 80% was also lauded in the study. So, we do not have to talk about hypotheticals. We have Yale health which is an institution that is widely respected and held in high esteem, publishing research in a peer reviewed journal. This is not a commercial that claims 6 out of 10 dentists prefer this toothpaste, this is a legitimate study proving efficacy.  
What do we like to see when we see an innovation that is first to market? We want patents to protect that innovation, otherwise if successful and it generates revenue well above cost, then competitors will jump in and compete on price driving down margins. What do we have with Hyperfine, the first ever portable MRI. We have 99 issued patents with 285 pending. We need to lock up that technology to prevent others from jumping in the space. That is important in building a moat, and something I look for as an investor in investing in innovation.  
So, what does the future looks like for Hyperfine. Or at least their planned future. They have merged with Liminal sciences which is a bit of a speculative play but adds potential upside and fits into the Hyperfine product. Liminal sciences are attempting build a device that monitors vital signs in the brain using machine learning and AI to predict outcomes allowing doctors more access. It is important to mention it is a noninvasive approach. This to me is a throw into the deal it has potential upside but at this point is a bit of an unknown, they are hoping this comes online in 2023.  
Hyperfine hopes to finish production on a portable MRI that can be used on the spine and extremities by 2023 as well. This builds on existing technology and is a sure bet than the Liminal brain vital sign monitoring. They are also looking to develop guided intervention which includes robotics to assist with life-saving interventions surgery, and a breast MRI to detect breast cancer. For my investment thesis, I am only considering the portable MRI that currently exists and other iterations of it, as they have proof of concept of these. As far as the robotics and AI components that is a possibility that brings upside but is more speculative. The TAM is projected at 23 billion which is huge. That just gives you an idea of the market, obviously not sales, but that there is a need or a market to sell the product.  
The financials are not much to speak of now a prediction of 2.3 million in 2021. Rising to over 300 million in 2025. Current valuation comes in at under a billion at 956 million which I do not find terrible given how hot the market is. However, it is still expensive given the current projected sales. My own analysis I did not use the 300 million in 2025 to create a price target I trimmed that down to 280, as I did not want to include some of the more speculative plays like the AI brain sensing device, and surgical robots. That does not mean that they will not happen, but there is not proof of concept. Even at the lower projection using a 15 high multiple and a 10 low multiple I think that if the company can execute the stock should be worth between 37 and 44 by 2025. Discounting back to present value and adding in a margin of safety of 25%, currently the fair value is currently around $13 meaning that it is undervalued. If you want to see how I calculated this watch the video.  
It is a SPAC trading under 10 dollars before the merger. I expect a high redemption rate it could be as anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of shares here get redeemed, causing the stock to dip initially and then recovering witth a strong bounce. If this happens my valuations are not accurate as there is less cash for the company, and less shares outstanding. 
 In this case they have some money from the pipe, and fewer shares means a lower market cap which I hope for. I think they will still get the money that they need to inject into their business, and as an investor I will get a better valuation. Win win. So, I have bought a few shares, I hope to buy the day after the merger vote, where I anticipate a lot of redemptions and a significant drawdown. There is more information in the video if you want more depth

13|'Ghost kitchens' boom in Asia as new lockdowns rise with new wave of infections ($JK)|4|prfq8b|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/prfq8b/ghost_kitchens_boom_in_asia_as_new_lockdowns_rise/|1|" The overwhelming demand for food delivery created by the COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the growth of ""ghost kitchens,"" restaurants without dining rooms that serve food strictly for delivery.

The US ghost kitchen industry has grown to at least 1,500 restaurants, according to research firm Euromonitor, and estimates the global market for ghost kitchens could surpass $1 trillion by 2030. Such companies successfully riding this trend include $GRUB $DASH $CMG $DENN $WMT $KR $CHUY $SBUX $DPZ $UBER $EAT $JK

I want to talk about one of many ghost kitchen giants in South- East Asia that have been on my radar, which have said to prospectively grow into new territories. Let's talk about JustKitchen.

JustKitchen ($JK, $JK.V, $JKHCF) is a Taiwanese based company founded in 2019, successfully listed in the Toronto Venture Exchange (TSXV) and OTC Markets. The company is primarily an operator of ghost kitchens specializing in the development and marketing of proprietary and delivery-only food brands for consumers. JustKitchen uses a hub-and-spoke operating model, combined with online and mobile application based food ordering carried out by third-party delivery companies like DoorDash ($DASH) and GrubHub ($GRUB).

Analyst Cooper foresees continued growth for JustKitchen, with an expectation of $12.7 million in revenue for 2021, followed by a 193 per cent potential year-over-year increase to $37.2 million for 2022, followed by a potential 48.4 per cent year-over-year jump to $55.2 million for 2023. Below is a link for more info.

Listed are their highlights:

* Food and beverage sales of $3,346,897 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2021 compared to $479,664 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2020; similarly, sales reached $7,482,348 for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2021 compared to $712,801 reported for the 217-day period from November 27, 2019 to June 30, 2020
* Approximate sales volume grew to 214,744 retail customer food orders in the third quarter from 128,400 retail customer food orders in second quarter of 2021, which is an increase of 67%;
* Opened a new ghost kitchen location in Taoyuan, Taiwan;
* Launched two new delivery-only offerings including the TGI Fridays Go Burgers Collection and the Cali Vibe proprietary bento food brand;
* Entered into an agreement to collaborate in the Hong Kong market with Foodpanda, which is the dominant customer food order fulfilment platform in the region and a global online food and grocery delivery brand owned by Berlin-based Delivery Hero;
* Signed a Hong Kong-focused collaborative agreement with Zeek, which provides smart logistics with integrated on-demand delivery services for Hong Kong and Southeast Asia;
* Launched multiple delivery-only desserts in association with Paul Café, the global chain of bakeries and cafés with operations in 47 countries that was founded in France in 1889;
* Acquired the virtual branding rights to the Hutong Yakiniku brand from GYEN Intl Business Co., Ltd., which is one of the best Japanese barbecue cuisine offerings in Taiwan and has rapidly become a well-known name both locally and abroad with 11 restaurants in Taiwan, 11 in China and one in Hong Kong;
* Acquired the virtual branding rights to the local Taiwanese Ice Monster brand, which is a popular shaved ice dessert shop that successfully expanded to Japan and China in 2015 and Hawaii in 2017;
* Hired Michael Liu as its Executive Vice President of Operations, who prior to his current role with JustKitchen was the Head of Commercial for Deliveroo in Taiwan since 2019, which involved leading a commercial team of over 40 professionals connected to a portfolio of over 5,000 restaurant partners
* Warren Tseng appeared as an industry panelist as part of a session entitled ""The Ghost Kitchen Tech Stack"" during The Spoon's Restaurant Tech Summit on August 17, 2021
* Temporarily operated ghost kitchen locations between the months of June and August within the underutilized Marriott Courtyard Taipei Downtown and Madison Taipei hotels.

Now, as infection rates are climbing around the world, governments are imposing new restrictions due to the new wave of the delta variant. This means high demand for food delivery, which in turn is a golden opportunity for the ghost kitchen industry to grow exponentially. I'm no financial advisor, but I can assume we’ll see a spike in stock value for many of these companies in this sector.

Personally I think this is a great investment potential, especially at it’s dips. JustKitchen’s stock already has a good buy rating, and a TP of 3.40 as shown on MarketScreener. IMO, buying one of the dips around 1.60 and holding till 3.40 looks like a great investment, and who knows how much the value could rise (higher than TP). Hope you all enjoyed my DD, let me know what you guys think. And of course do your own DD. Cheers.

14|Impending Doom?|8|prfog4|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/prfog4/impending_doom/|53|"I have been looking and thinking very hard of a couple of catalysts which I fear could be catastrophic on the markets. It also seems mainstream media is not really digging into it very much and almost treating these two things as a passing storm...

Supply Chain shortages

The entire global supply chain is pretty much on its knees. Until a couple of weeks ago it was a lot about the container and shipping shortages, but the repercussions of raw materials and the impact on earnings across many industries is inevitable. I think it is hitting retail initially, moving on to manufacturing and other needed commodities, which will eventually hit top line and bottom line very hard in the upcoming few earnings. If you have nothing to sell, there is nothing to buy, means less income and the need to lower costs. The shipping industry is the blood veins of global trade, and with this completely blocked for what i perceive to be indefinitely, is going to be huge issue coming out of Q3 + Q4.

Evergrande default in China

Many people are wondering how this could affect Europe and North America. Well its simple in terms of the second biggest property developer in china (who have hundreds of assets bought at over inflated prices) will eventually leave most of its investors and creditors out of pocket for billions of dollars. The sub suppliers, employees and many others attached to this company will not be able to sustain the losses and potentially go bankrupt themselves.

Many ""wealthy"" Chinese have investments outside of china and have been paying over inflated prices driving real estate up in many countries around the world (Canada as an example), and how to recoup their losses or pay off debt to avoid bankruptcy? Well maybe one quick way would be to reduce exposure in other countries to get hold of cash out quickly.

I saved my first 10k and started investing 4 years ago, at 25 years old. I speed ran that up to 94k up until about 5 months ago, when it all fell apart. I turned that 94k into 45k in 3 months with highly leveraged bets gone wrong. I was pissed for about a month, all I could think about. But you know what 45k compounded at 30 years at 10% is? 800k

That’s without a single penny of additional contribution, my monthly income exceeds my monthly spending by about 250, so even investing just half of that back into the market is 1,040,000 with all the rest of the assumptions the same.

I’m at 53k now in that account, and back to a cash only account.  27k IRA and 401k funds(not included in post). 31k I’m house principal paid off. Still over 100k in total assets. While by no means am I made for life, At 29 years old I can live a comfortable lifestyle, all because I started early.

IV (Implied Volatility) shot up last week, with only a small price jump. Yellow bars denote call volume, blue puts. As you can see the volume is almost completely bullish. I believe this bodes well for us.

Now we get to the interesting part. Ortex, as well as Finviz (pictured below) shows that it has 40%+ short float, but other sources say its closer to 11. I believe it is 11, but at the end of the day it has little affect. If the short interest is low, price should move up to close gap. If short interest is high, then eventually true fair value will be found.

I believe we are moving towards a leg up sooner than later + this is picking up steam on financial - twitter.

A few years ago I stumbled upon TQQQ. Seeing the massive returns it was having, I digged and studied the subject, doing quite a good amount of DD on it.

My conclusione were essentally 3:
1) TQQQ returns aren't real as it gets rebalanced daily and doesnt work as long term investment. 

2) If the market falls 33%, you get wiped out. This kind of Crash already happened three times in the last 20 years.

3) People on some websites and forum were saying that, cause losses weight much more than gains, it was virtually impossible to make money with TQQQ.

Therefor, I decided to do not invest in it.

However lately I keep seeing youtubers, people and twitter and Reddit pointing out how amazing this etf is, that it has averaged a 55% return since 2010 and that they do not understand why people do not go all in on it.

They say that
1) Returns are real. If you invested 1000 dollars in 2010 they would be worth 86.000 today.

2) You cant get wiped out as market never crashes 33% in a day cause it gets halted, and if it Fall 33% overall you do not get wiped out as loses compound inversely as gains.

3) Invest in TQQQ is much better and profitable than ANY stock picking, etf or strategy on the market.

Where is the truth? I do not understand.

Anyone invested in it for like 3-5 years and can report their experience? Thank you"|1632060769.0

24|Calculating EPS on Yahoo Finance - What am I missing?|7|pr69mx|StockMarket|https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/pr69mx/calculating_eps_on_yahoo_finance_what_am_i_missing/|6|"This might be a dumb question or may have already been asked elsewhere but couldn't find it. I'm looking at Yahoo Finance's EPS they listed for their stocks. Let's take Tesla for example. The current ttm EPS they have listed is 1.90. Fair enough. When I take the ttm net income they have listed of 2,150,000,000 and divide it by the shares outstanding they have listed of 1B, this gives me an EPS of 2.15. Is this a rounding error or am I an idiot? I know fornsure both these figures are rounded figures.

Even it is a rounding error, would they not calculate the EPS from the very figures they are providing us? Rounded or otherwise?

Thanks in advance."|1632051132.0
