8|I do not understand the purpose of leverage|3|prhsjt|Forex|https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/prhsjt/i_do_not_understand_the_purpose_of_leverage/|3|"i do not know anything about forex trading, but interested in learning. i mostly trade theta in options.

recently forex caught my interest and doing some learning.

something i never understood about leverage was the purpose of it beyond ""magnified gains"".

and i recently learned that leverage is common to use in forex. especially compared to stocks/options.

and i dont understand why. i get the point of leverage is for bigger gains. and if youre using it for that purpose, it makes sense. for example, lets say a greedy person, or someone with a a high risk tolerance  only has a 10k account because thats all they can afford, using leverage makes sense.

but (unless im mistaken here) based on context, to me it seems like people that doesnt need to use leverage uses it still. for someone, if someone has a 10k account, i see them saying they would use like a 2:1 leverage so they can employ the rest of their capital somewhere else. or use X:1 leverage so they dont have all their money risked/involved.

whats the purpose of this? since if you lose on the trade using leverage, you still have to pay it out."|1632089768.0

10|Eurusd analysis using Elliott Wave Principle|0|prkcoz|Forex|https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/prkcoz/eurusd_analysis_using_elliott_wave_principle/|1|"Hello everyone, 

I dont post on reddit much but I am going to try to post more actively going forward. Below are my thoughts on EURUSD. 

EURUSD seems to have completed a wave 2 and might give us a up move towards 1.21 area and much higher if proves to be right but I trade each wave so for now target will be 1.21

There is an alternative scenario where eurusd will go to 1.12/1.14 areas before continuing up but as far as eurusd is above 1.1663 that scenario will not come into play. So given that we have a solid bullish setup which gives us 5:1RR with entry at current price stop at 1.1663 and tp at 1.21 . 

Feel free if have any questions and if you want to troll Elliott wave theory please first display that you do have knowledge of it and you have used it.

11|EURUSD/GBPUSD/USDCAD Analysis|1|privv0|Forex|https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/privv0/eurusdgbpusdusdcad_analysis/|4|"In the past week, the DXY(dollar index)has been going up due to CPI and core retail sales, so currencies like EURUSD and GBPUSD have been going down and USDCAD has been going up. My analysis would be that the dollar will continue to gain value until the 93.6 area on DXY, around Wednesday when the FOMC statement comes out it could break the level and the dollar will continue to increase or rebound off of that level, so keep a watch out for that.

13|Non-Western trading techniques?|4|pr927v|Forex|https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/pr927v/nonwestern_trading_techniques/|16|"Hey everyone, perhaps this is a strange question but I haven't seen it discussed elsewhere.

From my understanding, candlesticks as a concept were introduced to the ""West"" from Japan and have largely replaced bar charts as our default form of charting. There are also other strategies and philosophies from Japan such as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo. Unlike candlesticks (thanks to Steve Nison) , the source materials for Ichimoku have sparsely been translated into English, although some good info does exist online. 

This got me wondering, are there other trading strategies, techniques, or ideas like Ichimoku currently being used around the world which we aren't exposed to in English speaking trading education? For example, are traders in China, Russia, Brazil, Japan, etc., doing largely the same stuff as everyone else? Or are there other novel strategies and concepts out there which we just aren't exposed to due to the language barrier? Is another ""candlesticks"" moment possible in the coming years?

I'm keen to hear your thoughts!"|1632062036.0

16|I don't quite understand PIP and Bps.|6|pr3hug|Forex|https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/pr3hug/i_dont_quite_understand_pip_and_bps/|7|"I have 2 questions and I was wondering if someone can clear something up for me.

1. looking at investopedia's definition of PIP, (or even Bps), its clear that 1Bps is = to 0.01% so 100Bps = 1%

it uses an example stating

>For example, the smallest move the USD/CAD currency pair can make is $0.0001 or one basis point. 

yet, if it goes from $0.0001 to $0.0002 thats a 100% change, or a 100Bps change. i am not seeing how thats a 1 basis point change.

2. my second question is just on the definition of PIP. it states it generally uses 4 decimal points because thats usually the defined rate for USA forex. but on some like the USA/YEN, it goes to 2 decimal points. does that mean in this case, 1 PIP change is only up to 0.01? (i.e. PIP definition is defined relative to the smallest possible quoted change? and not necessary locked to a defined term of $0.0001?)"|1632036763.0
17|Need some advice I’m on my 25 loss streak.|11|pr0ntb|Forex|https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/pr0ntb/need_some_advice_im_on_my_25_loss_streak/|50|"Sometimes trading can really make you feel shitty. My strategy has worked before, I don’t know why I’ve met with this many loss streak. It’s only happening in my forex account also, my crypto account is still doing well. Luckily I only risked 1% per trade, doesn’t make it feel less shitty though.

Is it because I’m tilting and my trading psychology is all messed up? Should I take a break on my forex account? Or should I just quit it all and only focus on trading crypto. Need some serious advice here, my hopes and dream of becoming a full-time trader is falling apart."|1632023023.0
