1|11/17/2023 Daily Plays GPS not good! Just less bad! ROST good, not great! POST very good IN EZPW at 8.15 may bid on SCM man I see SGD all over social media use RISK MANAGEMENT! 50 cents to 8 dollars in a few days. CAREFUL! Man ELF was about 90 last week! I still want CELH|2|17xg6ha|UltimateTraders|https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateTraders/comments/17xg6ha/11172023_daily_plays_gps_not_good_just_less_bad/|1|"Good morning everyone. All I did yesterday was buy 500 shares of EZPW at 8.15. I still hope to make 200+. I just didn‚Äôt want to get a lot of shares of anything but the earnings were good.

Overall Sales:

Increased from 233.4 million to 270.5 million or about 16%

Overall earnings:

Increased from 7.3 million to 10.3 million or about 30%

These are figures I like. The stock itself may not be in favor.. just like META was hammered like PYPL is hammered, but the execution from the company is fairly good. The thought process is as the company executes they will raise shareholder value:

Make Acquisitions

Buyback shares

Dividend

Special dividend

Payback Debt

I find myself writing about increasing shareholder value because I see tons of stocks rallying when all the actual company does is destroy shareholder value!

Insiders sell!

Dilution!

Bad financials!

Constant report of losses!

Even a decrease in sales and earnings!

WTF? And the stock is up?

In my book! Bad is bad! I don‚Äôt believe in this sandbag crap. No less bad and the stock rallies! Not for me! HD and today GPS ‚Ä¶.. even M if you have a decrease in sales or earnings or even worse both! You do not get a passing grade from me.. why?

You need to increase sales in order to make more money and be sustainable. If you made more money buy decreased sales‚Ä¶ it means you cut costs, how much costs can be cut with declining sales for you to stop earnings more!?

If you increase sales but don‚Äôt make money.. what the heck is the point of being busier but taking home less money‚Ä¶

Would you work 25% or 50% more for the same take home money?

DUH!

You have to treat a company like a person, or yourself‚Ä¶ If you just trade and you are doing well, hey hats off to you! But the reason why 90%+ of traders fail is because they strongly believe they can momentum trade and win most of the time. If you take your time, study and know fundamentals, you can not lose long term! You can not! Yes, its more work, slower and more boring but how you trade, what you trade is up to you!

GPS less bad and the stock is on fire.. NOPE NOT ME! I wouldn‚Äôt buy or sell it.. but no one is forcing me to trade it! Yes, it has some serious momentum‚Ä¶

10 minute research you can see that sales were higher even near 10 years ago!! Earnings were insanely higher in 2014 and 2015! THAT IS NO FUD! Open some financials. Look, companies change, they adapt, even in just 1 quarter‚Ä¶ and to be honest the most important thing to me is the last 2 quarters, the quarter we are in and the 1 quarter ahead‚Ä¶ however 1 quick 10 minute snapshot tells you what you need to know about GPS ‚Ä¶ or many of the other retailers M or even ROST who did have a good report. ROST has increased sales over the years‚Ä¶ but they made just as much money on far less sales in 2018 and 2019! FACTS! Now, I wouldn‚Äôt buy or sell ROST the company is fine, not in trouble, it just isn‚Äôt enticing enough to me at these prices. 

Check the overall sales and earnings on EZPW 

You want to see a company on a crazy upswing‚Ä¶

Check ELF over the years!

CELH is insane! 

That is why I like these as growth companies‚Ä¶actually ELF makes money! I didn‚Äôt like CELH 2 years ago but they are growing into the lofty valuations, that is what quality companies do‚Ä¶ or growth companies!

I like to get companies growing sales, growing earnings‚Ä¶. At least have a business plan where you have profits sometime soon? 2-4 quarters‚Ä¶ and if you cant make money for 6 quarters \[18 months\] NO THANK YOU! You do you! No FOMO here. 

POST is a consumer package company. They box up goods, pretty good report. I may try the dividend king SCM . I am still in PSEC at 5.80. I see SGD all over social media. Risk management! This thing shoots from 50 cents to 8 in days.. there are no shares available, and the overall count is near 10 million, just careful for the rug pull please!

5 Trade Ideas:

CELH ELF ‚Äì I wanted ELF when it was near 90 less than 10 days ago, I am eyeing CELH closely, it is a little risky as they don‚Äôt make a ton of money yet, but the 100% growth is very very serious!

EPZW ‚Äì I am in this pawn shop 500 shares at 8.15 I hope to sell 8.50+ ?

SCM ‚Äì This dividend king had mediocre earnings. However, the earnings does support their strong dividend. Like PSEC this moves very slow and I don‚Äôt see a lot of upside, but I see the safety in this trade

HTZ ‚Äì Don‚Äôt get it twisted, these earnings were bad but this is down 60% off the 52 week high, I don‚Äôt like to normally buy companies where numbers are going down, but this is way overdone, jesus

RBLX AFRM ‚Äì I still want puts on these disasters that are far away from earning money, that have barely 20-30% growth but insane valuations

3|11/16/2023 Daily Plays What are companies saying about the 4th quarter? R they bullish? PANW NVDA NOW great companies priced for perfection YANG on fire, I added it back to plays last month! RBLX pumped its stock over 42 and I tried puts EZPW pawn shop very good earnings CASH? trading carefully|4|17wnqjt|UltimateTraders|https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateTraders/comments/17wnqjt/11162023_daily_plays_what_are_companies_saying/|3|"Good morning everyone. I was having a debate with someone yesterday about PANW. Nothing is wrong with PANW . It is a great company. I first traded it well over 10 years ago. At that time sales was growing near 100% and for a couple of years straight. It is still a great company, it is better than it was back then! But‚Ä¶ it is no longer a hyper growth company. Law of sizes, as you get bigger it is hard to grow 20% or more‚Ä¶ so very impressed recently by BKNG . No one has told me, or taught me about hyper growth. People may not value or project stock/company valuations like me. There is no rule to it, we make our own rules, and we must trade with what we feel comfortable with‚Ä¶

Because the SP500 is regarded as the stock market. \[Basket of 500 stocks, while the Dow is 30\] I must follow what the world considers the US market. The SP500 as the way we know it as has been around since 1957. There is a long history of data‚Ä¶. I did not just get my strategy from the sky!

The SP500 normally trades at 17-18x earnings \[This is the average, not all 500 companies\]

The average company grows sales at 10-20%

The average company earnings 5-10% more YOY

So‚Ä¶

If this is considered to the world the US market‚Ä¶ the standard‚Ä¶.

I came up with 30%+ to be considered hyper growth‚Ä¶ I use my own experience to put a multiple on a company that is growing at 40-50-100%. It is the nature of business that when a company is new to market that they will grow faster, need to make investments, lose money, so as the company ages‚Ä¶ matures‚Ä¶ the company‚Äôs stock will lose/contract their multiple‚Ä¶

If you were looking to buy a business on the street, saw riches, because the company was growing sales at 100% YOY youd want to get in and pay more for it?

Would you want to pay the same amount once they are growing 20%

PANW NOW

I like these companies and have followed them forever! FOREVER!

I traded them long as they were hyper growers. \[30%+\] but they still command high multiples‚Ä¶ since the market is doing so. 

CSCO was higher than it is now, in the 90s! In the 90s CSCO and GE were like the APPL MSFT of now. What happened? CSCO growth died! GE business/profits eroded‚Ä¶ We have to always check quarter to quarter‚Ä¶ AAPL was almost bankrupt without a 200 million infusion from Bill Gates‚Ä¶ they would be done! AAPL MSFT GOOG META AMZN they have all adapted, they have found ways to increase shareholder value over time‚Ä¶ Even TSLA at 1 point, was creating some shareholder value‚Ä¶ not anymore!   
 So this is not an attack on PANW ‚Ä¶ I like NOW as well..

I last traded shares of NVDA long around 2017! Do you know 1,000 invested in NVDA IPO in 1999 is worth millions now! Not a typo! I always liked NVDA, just the valuation has gotten out of hand‚Ä¶ However, I will admit the last quarter was very impressive. It proved me WRONG! NVDA went from a decline in sales, decline in earnings to massive 60% growth in sales, 100% in earnings and does deserve a nice premium‚Ä¶ but 80-100x? That is the question‚Ä¶..

What are most companies saying about the 4th quarter? Yes, there are outliers, but I saying even TGT yesterday? TGT was on fire, what is management saying about the 4th quarter? What did mighty WMT say today? PANW ? The MEME favorite darling TSLA had a disaster 3rd quarter? You believe they will do better 4th? LOL! Overall margins fell to 7.6% near Toyota TM , look it up! MSFT META AMZN were impressive, hats off! AAPL bad earnings, not awful.. but bad! Sales down 1-2% YOY on AAPL, earnings down. \[EPS is up because of share buyback, which I like, it does raise shareholder value, but doesn‚Äôt give you the actual health of sales/earnings\]

I am a BULL! You can not be a Bear long term.. But what are these companies saying? What is the health? Do you see sales up 10-20%? Earnings 5-10% YOY ? 

I SURE DON‚ÄôT!

So‚Ä¶. No FOMO here, I don‚Äôt need convicing.. I need to see NUMBERS! DATA that support this fierce bull rally! If not, it is all hype to me!

Man, I did add YANG to plays last month and it was in the 9s. It is a bear China ETF. I got killed with Chinese stocks summer of 2021 and for now, do not have confidence in Chinese stocks long. Cant blame someone if they do, but not me! RBLX pumped the stock with Playstation downloads.. but all they do is lose money! It did pump over 42 and I did enter an order for puts but no fill. EZPW had good earnings, they are a publicly traded pawn shop.. Consumers need cash? Go to get cheaper items their? Is this the start?

5 Trade Ideas:

EZPW ‚Äì Just added to plays, I have traded this for many years, earnings were good, is it time?

PSEC ‚Äì I have shares at 5.80 and would like 15-25 cents

YANG ‚Äì China bear ETF on the move!

RBLX ‚Äì Earnings were yuck and when it spikes over 40, I am getting teased for puts

CELH ‚Äì Drink maker started to make money, insane growth near 100%, I havent put in a bid yet, I am hoping it sells off, I may want shares and or calls

Still value PYPL LNTH SWAV TGLS TITN AER CVS near 52 week highs insider buys PSEC 11/10 after monster earnings if you like growth CELH HIMS YOU no FOMO on speculation TGT eh not good EH! Good luck!|1|17vur65|UltimateTraders|https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateTraders/comments/17vur65/11152023_daily_plays_fierce_rally_didnt_the/|17|"Good morning everyone. Can not go against the bull herd indeed. This is why a few weeks ago before the fierce rally, \[Which is when the market already decided the hikes were done after the Powell speech.\] doesn‚Äôt make sense, but momentum is momentum. You will recall before this utopia and euphoria I wanted to open puts slowly. I didn‚Äôt want to pile on puts until I had conviction. Conviction never came‚Ä¶ and when Powell had hawkish comments a few weeks ago the market ran. I currently have 3 puts.. and would be willing to add 2 more for a total of 5. These are small bets about 1,000 on each, well small for me. You will recall when the plan was working and the market came off in early 2022 I had as much as 50 puts at a time and average was 2,000. I am not a gambler, once I started to lose on some puts November of 2022 I backed off. I am not Mr Burry that makes wide bets and doesn‚Äôt learn. No one can accurately predict the rise and fall of the stock market‚Ä¶ NO ONE! It is a daily auction built on sentiment‚Ä¶ and if we don‚Äôt believe it is an auction, just look at the pathetic earnings from TSLA . If this wasn‚Äôt TSLA based on those earnings it should have been down 33% or more in this market to maybe 160.. but it is TSLA! And now it is around 240-243 which is where it was pre earnings, pathetic, horrible earnings‚Ä¶ but that is my point! 

Me, saying fair value on the SP500 is 3,500 does not mean it is going there. It means based on earnings/sales economic data and the cash flows that a company can produce this is where it should trade‚Ä¶

A company‚Äôs ability to make free cash flow should be the ultimate key to the value of shares‚Ä¶

Free cash flow is used to buy back shares, make acquisitions, make investments, pay dividends, special dividends, pay down debt‚Ä¶

So‚Ä¶.

If the SP500 is at 4,600 that does not change a company‚Äôs ability to make cash, earn cash and raise shareholder value‚Ä¶

I have developed my strategies over nearly 30 years of trading since I was 14. It works for me! No FOMO here. I am fully invested in retirement accounts which are made up mostly of index funds‚Ä¶ I checked them this morning, I have them in about 5 places and they are up 11 to 14%. I do not day trade these accounts, not even my IRA‚Äôs they are just there until 65 or emergency. I have 2 IRA‚Äôs that have shares of PSEC with reinvestment‚Ä¶ 

Point is, no FOMO here, you have to do what works for you. I am not going to be FOMOed into buying garbage stuff with no free cash flows and higher multiples because of APES.

I am not Burry that made a huge bet on the market crashing.. I take a measured approach.

In 2008 when the market crashed, I didn‚Äôt short it to death.. I saw the alerts, I cut down my exposure to stocks to 30% from about 70%... I did trade some puts, but it was measured, not a pile on‚Ä¶

The SP500 earnings for the 3rd quarter is better than I expected, but for the 9 months it is about what I expected.. which is bad! NOT GOOD, BAD! I expected from January to have earnings down overall about 3% and sales flat or up 5% for the year.... Based on earnings for the first 9 months we are down now maybe 2% and sales up under 5%! Check my posts from back then! The 4th quarter will decide if earnings are down for the year or not because the first 2 quarters were bad!

I am not a bear munger. It is not very bright to bet against the market/economy long term. Inflation is a natural phenomenon, we are always innovating and getting better.. However every 12 to 14 years, we will have a bear market, and you have to choose whether you want to still trade‚Ä¶. Or be on the sidelines like me! This momentum trading since the pandemic is beyond even the 90s‚Ä¶ It is working for many.. but dangerous to me. Look, summer of 2021 I gave in and was throwing grenades too! The difference then and now?

Interest rates were .125%, GDP was growing insanely because we just opened up the economy‚Ä¶ 

Sales growth was a record near 30-40%, Earnings 10-20% and this is a broad market! We had the perfect storm for a fierce rally‚Ä¶

NOT THIS, NOT NOW!

You do what works for you, I cant blame anyone, and I want everyone to make money.. When people make money they are happy, they spend‚Ä¶ it makes the world go round.. but it isn‚Äôt going to convince me‚Ä¶.. 

And I certainly am not wrong on the market/companies overall, you will see earnings near down 3% and sales flat to 5% for the entire year... but just because I can accurately predict performance of most companies does not mean I, especially anyone else can predict the movement of the stock market‚Ä¶ Fair value changes when a company shows execution and ability.. fair value does not change because a stock is bidded up or sold off‚Ä¶ I value a company based on its ability to make money, have cash flows‚Ä¶ not based on Apes bidding or selling‚Ä¶

There are still very good buys, PYPL LNTH SWAV TGLS TITN AER CVS these are companies with earnings, financials, raise shareholder value, if you want to bet and wait for a company to turn around HTZ . If you want growth and can pay ELF CELH HIMS YOU if you want a tiny speculative stock that just announced earnings, that deals with mobile traffic UCL . UCL is a gamble, just saying! TGT earnings were up but sales were down 4%. I wont say the earnings were bad, they were just ok, you need both numbers up! I don‚Äôt believe in buying a stock because results were less worse than expected‚Ä¶ I want to buy a stock that slams earnings! I wouldn‚Äôt buy or short TGT I am just saying‚Ä¶ PSEC had very good earnings and another insider was buying 11/10 after earnings already reported. After a monster rally, avg near 5.70. This buy was about 30,000 but keep in mind many of these directors are making 175K a year! You can find that on Morningstar ‚Ä¶ So what is that after taxes? 100K? And you are going in 30K with near 33% of your annual income. BULLISH! SCM another dividend king was low 12s I did want it but didn‚Äôt go in. There are good buys, I just wont take part in garbage stocks bidded up. I also only want at most 5 puts at a time. The 3 I have expire 12/15, if I lose 3K I will live! LOL

I have 4 ongoing evictions that cost me 1,500 each in just litigation that will cover 1 visit in court.. 1,000 more for each day in court!

5 Trade Ideas:

PSEC ‚Äì Last in 5.80, 2000 shares. I have traded this most of the year for 10-30 cents per trade. I have gotten stuck buy it ultimately comes back for me

PYPL ‚Äì Man, last sale was near 54.70, it is still cheap, watching closely

TSLA ‚Äì Those earnings were beyond pathetic, rise to 245 for puts

CELH ‚Äì Just split 3 for 1, man, slammed to 150, 50 after very good earnings, not sure if I want just calls or shares

AI ‚Äì Some news with AMZN and this flies to 30 LOL horrible numbers and execution

8|11/14/2023 Daily Plays HD is a very good indicator of the market CPI comes in at 3.2% which is good, but we already priced in no more rake hikes 3 weeks ago, what difference is this? I did want PYPL yesterday but did not bid DUOL 220+ BA 210? I rather CELH and SWAV of good earnings|2|17v2ee1|UltimateTraders|https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateTraders/comments/17v2ee1/11142023_daily_plays_hd_is_a_very_good_indicator/|21|"Good morning everyone. I have an early doctor‚Äôs appointment so I have to leave about 8:45. I didn‚Äôt try any moves yesterday. I did watch PYPL. I am pretty much in limbo and I am fine with that. 3rd quarter earnings are slightly better than expected but arent at all good. I expected earnings to be down 2-3% and sales to be near even‚Ä¶ we are at earnings up 3.5% and sales up 2.3%. Even with these earnings, if they stay the course, the earnings will still be down about 2% year over year. These are not horrible numbers but they are bad. Just remember we have not had a decline of over 3% in earnings since 2009. \[2020 does not count\]! On those years normally the SP500 trades at 15x or below. History is not always going to be exact, but history can put you on alert to be careful. In my retirement accounts I have mostly index funds, a few mutual funds, so I am always invested for the long term. My long term trading account has 10 stocks from the 2008 crash. My day trading account I am in 90% cash. 2023 for me, has been the year of the least amount of trades in over 10+ years. This of course is not the plan, but you trade with the opportunities the market gives you, and the risks that you are willing to take. The market has rallied too much on bad news and I do not see upside here, even if things get better!

Things get better

Rates start to fall

Sales back to 10%+ YOY

Earnings back to 5%+ YOY

These are just the main things I look for, for a bullish market. We are rallying with no where near good data‚Ä¶..  HD just reported earnings. This is very good indicator of the economy. Earnings were down over 10% while sales were down 3% ‚Ä¶ What does this indicate?

This is telling me we are slowly getting worse, not better! So, I am surprised earnings are up 3.5% overall year over year.. I am not surprised that sales are up slightly‚Ä¶ with inflation it is normal if you collect more dollars‚Ä¶ but it is hard to make more because inflation causes margins to contract‚Ä¶ this is a good indicator. Unemployment has rose from 3.4% to now 3.9%... 

Shockingly we had GDP at 4.9%.. but 4th quarter is expected to be down to 2.1%.....

Once we have GDP near flat to negative and unemployment to near 5%... that indicates a recession.. The numbers are getting worse‚Ä¶ not better!

I want to get in as the numbers start to turn!!! Everyone is in early! Yes, the numbers will get better, I am sure! But we are way early! We will be lucky to see these numbers in June/July of 2024, and although I want to trade earlier, I will not force it‚Ä¶.

Great luck to you if you are doing well. I do not mind swinging up to 5 quality stocks at price that is below fair value‚Ä¶ and getting up to 5 puts of overpriced stocks‚Ä¶

Quality stocks:

PE ratio below SP500 \[Currently about 20\]

Grows earnings above the SP500 \[5-10%\]

Grows sales above the SP500 \[10-20%\]

That is what I define as a cheap stock!

PYPL has a PE of near 11, so though it is growing sales at 8%, it is clearly trading at a discount to the SP500.

5 Trade Ideas: CPI just came out at 3.2% which is fairly good actually, but we have rallied already

BA ‚Äì Earnings were awful, I know I see new contracts but if this sales over 210 for puts

CELH ‚Äì This energy drink did have great earnings and flew near 190 a week ago! Now it is slumped and may fall below 160 for calls?

DUOL ‚Äì Can we see 220+ for puts, earnings were good, valuation is crazy, maybe if this was 125‚Ä¶

PYPL ‚Äì Man could have gotten this yesterday low 54s

SWAV ‚Äì Strong earnings and this has slumped.. watching carefully

The Fed comments were rather hawkish, bearish‚Ä¶ if we do not get 1 more hike, we wont see any cuts till way later in 2024. According to the market, they are looking for cuts of near 1% for the year. \[We are at 5.35%\] and the market sees cuts coming as early as spring‚Ä¶ I do not see any cuts until 3rd quarter of 2024‚Ä¶ And if we do get cuts earlier it would only come if we enter a recession! Or have a serious drop off in figures‚Ä¶..

Unemployment flies to 4.5% \[We are at 3.9%\]

GDP falls negative \[We were just at 4.9% and current estimate for 4th quarter 2023 is 21.%\]

JOLTS Job openings collapses to 5 million \[We were well over 9 million\]

So‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

At the end of the day do we really want rates to get cut early?

The only way rates get cut early we will have to have drastic drop in data figures‚Ä¶.

I do see us having a gradual drop. 2nd Quarter GDP figures will come in July, and I don‚Äôt see any drop in rates until that happens and if those are bad‚Ä¶ This is because we are running hot! With data that suggest the Fed should actually hike us at least 1 more time! But hey, I am not the Fed‚Ä¶

We had CPI at 3.7%, GDP 4.9%, 9.5 million job openings, 3.9% unemployment, still very healthy, inflationary numbers actually‚Ä¶

We do have a CPI reading tomorrow, we are expected about 3.3%

I have 3 puts with some time. I am OK if I lose. I put slightly under 1,000 on each, PLTR NFLX ROKU . I opened all 3 puts when the stock rallied hard.. They just continued to rally. PLTR earnings were ok, not good, but ok it soared, NFLX were good, same thing it soared‚Ä¶. ROKU earnings were atrocious! Want to see real earnings? Check this morning MNDY a software company. If you follow me here or Twitter I have watched this insane growth for well over a year at MNDY, I was actually getting puts early 2022, they didn‚Äôt earn the valuation, they are slowly growing into it now. DUOL had good earnings but the valuation makes no sense to me. 0. This is a 9 billion dollar company that is still losing a little bit of money‚Ä¶ Can they earn a good valuation? If they keep executing, but generally these companies slow down‚Ä¶.

LNTH and SWAV both do medical devices, make money and have 30% or more growth and its getting pounded! I would rather have these 2 profitable companies than ROKU or DUOL ‚Ä¶.

But the stock market is a popularity contest‚Ä¶ AER is a cash maker, finds ways to raise shareholder value and is back near 52 week highs, I was trading this a lot high 50s and low 60s, but I am trading so careful‚Ä¶ I have traded PSEC and PYPL all year and will do so as I feel safe in these 2 plays. They both had recent good earnings, stocks cratered still‚Ä¶ PSEC pays you to HODL, PYPL is buying back shares.. there is a reason to hold these, not just hype!

5 Trade Ideas:

PYPL ‚Äì I am eyeing this and had a few days ago low 54

DUOL ‚Äì As this flew near 220 I did enter a bid for puts, no fills

SWAV LNTH ‚Äì They both create value and are medical device makers with earnings, growth, fairly good balance sheets

RBLX ‚Äì Please 40+ for puts, I tried last week when it flew near 42, I do not want more than 5 puts at a time

TOST ‚Äì Just off of 52 week lows, the TAM \[Total addressable market\] Restaurants, some retail is enormous, the growth is near 40% and they are near breakeven, still speculative but they offer something great that no one has for these stores

12|11/10/2023 Daily Plays Many of us had PSEC earnings were good stock fire! Going back in, I want back in PYPL hmm TOST 13? TTD oversold soon? DOCS and WYNN very good I did try AFRM puts and sad didnt get filled on RBLX puts days after I tried LMND they have an offering WTF! 19 to 14!|3|17s55yq|UltimateTraders|https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateTraders/comments/17s55yq/11102023_daily_plays_many_of_us_had_psec_earnings/|12|"Good morning everyone. I still have a small elite team, we do talk on Whatsapp, it is small about 10 of us. I have known them since I came on Reddit early 2021. I must admit, I was very shocked that PSEC crashed to 5. The last earnings report was very good so I didn‚Äôt think 3rd quarter would be bad. I did get worried when competitors were missing, it tanked the whole sector. I try to limit risk but not getting more than 2-3 blocks, when the market is bad I just keep 1 block‚Ä¶ and hope the company that has recently delivered good earnings can do it again‚Ä¶ that is not always the case, but we can only work on the most recent reports. Some strong reasons why I like PSEC.

The CEO Jon Barry, I have actually met 3x, at annual shareholders meetings in NYC, last time 2011. I attended 2009, 10 and 11. 

He owns 74 million shares are over 20% of the company

He has 0 salary

He bought shares during the 3rd quarter of 2023 with cash, not options!

Other Insiders bought shares in September

6 Cents monthly dividends near 12% dividend yield \[72 cents a year on 5.95 share price, earnings support the dividend, so we must make sure of earnings, otherwise dividend may get cut\]

Steady dividends for near 20 years

Close to 5 billion cash given back

So I am glad to see most of the group had PSEC. We had a field day with it. Some of us have traded it back and forth all the way up and down 5 to 6. I got stuck in my shares \[2,000 at 5.96\] I didn‚Äôt choose to buy more.. I did sell yesterday at 6.01 and will be trading it back and forth until I get stuck‚Ä¶ if I get stuck, my back drop and safety net are the dividends that are paid for thru company earnings‚Ä¶ \[This is what I call ‚ÄúSuper Defensive‚Äù and I go into this stage when I see danger\] I consider a stock Super Defensive when it has at least a 5% dividend yield with a PE ratio below 10‚Ä¶ This is because when the PE is to high a company may or may not continue to have earnings to support the dividend‚Ä¶. 

No one has taught me these rules, these arent solid rules.. this comes from me trading since 1994‚Ä¶ Many times people ask me, is this written, did some analyst say‚Ä¶ no this comes from trial and error, many mistakes‚Ä¶ studying the moves of stocks, the economy and the market in general‚Ä¶. So I like stuff like SCM PSEC VLY KEY NWBI these stocks don‚Äôt normally fly, but they are safe to swing in a bad market.. They are slow movers, but when it is dangerous to trade, I may choose not to trade at all‚Ä¶.. 

PYPL is not a super defensive stock, many tech stocks may never pay any dividends, but it doesn‚Äôt even command a premium anymore‚Ä¶ The market is giving it near an 11x PE. They have good cash flows to buyback stock.. invest in the company, make an acquisition or do a special dividend/dividend. \[These are things needed to raise shareholder value\]

I talk a lot in 2023 about raising shareholder value because the stock market is working opposite of reality‚Ä¶. At least in 2020/2021 when the economy opened up, we had the stars align and a perfect reason for a bull run‚Ä¶ 2022 we came down as expected‚Ä¶.. 2023 we are up on the same bad news in 2022‚Ä¶ So I am lost and trading things that 

‚ÄúRAISE SHAREHOLDER VALUE!‚Äù

There is no shareholder value in

ROKU

AFRM

LMND

Even DKNG

There is indeed growth, but these companies lose money and wont make money for some time. LMND just did an offering.. These companies, although growing, are losing half the sales money‚Ä¶.

If you had a store..

You sold 1 million dollars that year‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Lost 500K‚Ä¶

Did you have a good year?

WTF!!! 

You can overpay for growth on a bull run‚Ä¶

And I understand‚Ä¶ we have been having a bull run‚Ä¶ but you choose to trade what works for you‚Ä¶. What you are comfortable with‚Ä¶

I have been trading near 30 years‚Ä¶ and for me‚Ä¶ it is not a time to trade momentum/speculative stocks‚Ä¶ I traded some MEMEs too! But that was 2021! Summer of 2021 was the first time I was throwing grenades since the 90s! A grenade is a stock that doesn‚Äôt have a business plan, cant make money within 18 months‚Ä¶ Sorry if you are in 1‚Ä¶ I made up grenades, there is no rule book! But you do what you are comfortable with! If you are winning, stacking greens, ignore any noise! If you are losing, be open, it takes 3-5 years to get very good at this!

Man, I did love DOCS at 20, if you search here at Ultimatetraders. I was trading YOU and PUBM but I cant hindsight trade, and I have been worried. I did bid on RBLX puts Wednesday.. LMND earlier in the week. I did try AFRM as it sailed over 26.. LOL 52 week highs, trash earnings from RBLX and AFRM .. yes the growth is over 30% which I do find good but the valuation for companies losing money is insane, this is not a bull market‚Ä¶ I do like DUOL started to make money, but this is insane! TTD is a real company, just started to make money, it has always had a premium..Is it oversold? I may try low 50s. Very good earnings from DOCS and WYNN.

5 Trade Ideas:

PSEC ‚Äì I want back in

PYPL ‚Äì When the market tanked I did throw in a bid

DUOL ‚Äì Software tech, good earnings but valuation issue

TOST ‚Äì I like the possibilities, still 35%+ growth and close to break even

AFRM ‚Äì I still want puts and hope for a rally again

I have been up since 5AM actually. I was tweeting as well. I actually tried to help the #AMCAPES and explain the situation like I try and tell you all. This is the same situation with PTON and with CVNA and you can insert a lot of tickers, over time you will recognize these for what it is. I did say last week that the CVNA numbers were indeed impressive. I was shocked. \[8 billion in debt, so doesn‚Äôt matter! They need to make way more money\] All over Twitter/X I was reading how the Apes did not understand why the stock wasn‚Äôt flying. So I spent about 1 hour reading the actual SEC 10Q quarterly report from AMC. Not the press release that they want you to see. I will also say, the numbers at AMC are indeed getting much better. But as I just wrote a few sentences with CVNA that is not enough. AMC has a near 4.8+ billion debt load. They have some time, they need to have a few billion by early 2025. They are paying 400+ million in interest per year at the moment. \[This is why EBIDTA doesn‚Äôt matter!!!\] They have loans as high as 12.75% . Please also keep in mind most of the debt was raised when interest rates were far lower. Their largest debt is 1.9 billion that has a floating rate at 8.42%, so the cost of this at the moment is rising! These are very important figures‚Ä¶ 

You will need to understand as a long, if you are an investor, not a trader, that you believe that the company can generate at least 2-3 billion by 2025 from their business‚Ä¶..

If they can not you are going to get diluted! Even if they refinance, it will be at higher rates!!!

You do not want that either!

The sad thing is they raised 325 million in September.. They are raising 350 million now‚Ä¶ and that cash is just getting burned‚Ä¶ 

IN OTHER WORDS YOU ARE LIKELY TO GET DILUTED MORE!

Stop trusting him! Check the facts‚Ä¶.

Unless you believe that AMC the business is somehow going to make 250 million per quarter. \[They just lost about 15 million on a very good quarter\] I will pray for you‚Ä¶ Trade at your own risk!

I want to highlight some Very Good earnings

MGM ‚Äì Resorts Casinos

TDG ‚Äì Airline parts

LI ‚Äì If you trust Chinese numbers, cars

WIX ‚Äì Software but valuation problem

DUOL ‚Äì Software but valuation problem

ALTG ‚Äì Rents and fixes construction equipment

OFIX ‚Äì Spine and Ortho devices‚Ä¶ Room for serious growth, I am watching!

PUBM ‚Äì Software for ads, the guidance was strong for next quarter

TWLO ‚Äì Cloud software, good but this is overbought

AFRM like RBLX garbage numbers. This is not a super bull market with no fear. I do not know why people are so optimistic. The data doesn‚Äôt support it. I do like 37% growth, however like RBLX, AFRM is losing tons of money. You do not get a good grade from me if half the sales you make are losses‚Ä¶ That is called APE SH-T . That may have worked in 2020/2021 but you cant fool me. This isn‚Äôt like TOST or GRAB that is near a break even with growth. RBLX and AFRM are far away at the moment. DKNG grew at 57% and is maybe 4-6 quarters away from money. I am looking at AFRM for puts too! I may trade my PYPL 

5 Trade Ideas:

RBLX ‚Äì I did bid on puts no fills, garbage

AFRM ‚Äì LOL they are bidding on garbage numbers again

PYPL ‚Äì I keep trading this baby!

OFIX ‚Äì Speculative but good report it was trading at near 10.50 I have never traded it but followed it for several months

PSEC ‚Äì On fire!

I also need to touch base with the bank, I have a closing in 2 weeks so this will be short and sweet.

For no reason of its own YOU got crushed down to 52 week lows. I must admit it is alarming and scares me. But the tech/security company has been coming out with great results. The stock action was not awarding execution from the company. Well the company said F U to the stock market and has come out with key metrics when you consider shareholder value.

YOU

Grew sales at 39%

Beat bottom line by almost 100%

Buyback shares 100 million announced

Special dividend announced

Raised regular dividend 29%

You can ask for no more than this when you consider a company raising shareholder value

I am glad that the stock market is awarding garbage RBLX

Sales did grow 30% again, it had been 10%, that is good. \[The market cap and multiple already have perfection priced in, so this is not acceptable]

RBLX ‚Äì Please rally to 45 those earnings were garbage and have always been garbage!

My main day trading account was TD ameritrade, now using Schwab app!|2|17pvptv|UltimateTraders|https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateTraders/comments/17pvptv/1172023_daily_plays_celh_swav_and_skwd_slam/|24|"Good morning everyone. I was told several weeks ago about the transition to Schwab from TD Ameritrade. I have had the Ameritrade account probably from around 2000! I opened my individual Etrade account in 1999. I had custodial accounts before then. I have to get used to the APP. I am very glad at least all my Watch Lists are there‚Ä¶ They look very different and don‚Äôt contain the same columns. The TD app stopped working yesterday morning.. I was given a lot of heads up, but I am so used to the TD that I just never bothered. I still did sell PYPL at 56.70 and bought back in at 55.10. I have been trading PYPL almost this entire year. PYPL trades at 11x earnings. It is a premium brand with good financials and steady cash flow. They have been buying back shares every quarter. They have done things to raise shareholder value‚Ä¶ given, they grow 8-10% year over year.. and I understand why you don‚Äôt give this a 20x PE. \[The way earnings are going the SP500 is trading at about 20x!!\] If you give PYPL a 14x multiple, it is a premium brand, you get about 70. This is the price I feel safe trading at‚Ä¶. You may recall last year when META dropped in the 80s I called it stupid! Below 150 at the time was a steal‚Ä¶ I feel the same way about PYPL. Remember, the stock market is a popularity contest and it is in the dog house! I feel the same way with CVS. I traded CVS many times and got stuck several months ago at 84. The earnings and cash flow at the company are damn good! Earnings last week were damn good! I feel it should be at least 90! It will generate 12.5-13.5 billion cash for the year, it is trading at 7x cash flow. It has a PE ratio of near 8 as well! STUPID! I understand the market never gives a pharmacy a high PE but I see 10-11x. They will earning around 8.50..

The point is I will keep trading stuff like PYPL and CVS until I get stuck. I will not get another block but I will stick with the stocks. These are premium name brands with good financials coming off of good earnings‚Ä¶ PFE was a solid name, solid financials, but came off of disaster numbers so I sold at a loss‚Ä¶ I like these names, long term you cant lose with a company with a super low PE that is creating shareholder value..

Wow CELH grows sales at 105% and makes money too! I always loved the growth at CELH. The valuation was a question, but they are growing into their valuation. If you check what has happened to MNST wow! KO bought BodyArmor. But companies that can continue to grow are the ones that will be 10 baggers! HIMS grew sales at 57%, which is good, but it isn‚Äôt the 80-100%, a little disappointed to be honest, they beat estimates, but I was hoping for at minimum 70%. I want to highlight these earnings

Excellent:

CELH ‚Äì Drinks

SVWA ‚Äì I loved this company, medical devices

SKWD ‚Äì Insurance

Very good:

DDOG ‚Äì Cloud Software

FOR ‚Äì Develops land
