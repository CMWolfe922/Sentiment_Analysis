#  Book Descriptions & Covers:

&#x200B;

[**How to Make Money in Stocks**](https://amzn.to/3ujiApd) **by William O'Neil**

* This book is about growth investing. O'Neil explains what most successful stocks have done to be successful. He explains his 'CANSLIM' method, which is an acronym for 7 fundamental criteria which you can use to pick stocks. An AAII 8 year study of different strategies showed O'Neal's CAN SLIM with a 860% return from 1998-2005 (Second place). First place was Martin Zwieg's returning 1,659.3% (we will get to Zweig on this list too)

&#x200B;

# [The Little Book That Still Beats the Market](https://amzn.to/2OfR4d9) by Joel Greenblatt

* The idea of this book is to buy undervalued good businesses and hold them long-term, which will eventually beat the market index.

https://preview.redd.it/qmrq2minng191.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=46dd18b57e2bdc7afb8fa1f5e1ff025615d16a76

&#x200B;

# [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3ud6E8A) by Burton G. Malkiel

* This book covers investment bubbles, fundamental vs. technical analysis, modern portfolio theory, index funds, etc.

https://preview.redd.it/x7t5gloong191.png?width=329&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d43edcd511ef371a506419cec2ac8462a7d844a

&#x200B;

# [Principles](https://amzn.to/3wk9CtU) by Ray Dalio

* This book provides the insights from one of the biggest hedge fund managers of all time, and I think there are many great lessons to learn in this book!

https://preview.redd.it/cwv7dc4png191.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b5d86b9f669f59e1240f53628e59daf3ae97323

&#x200B;

# [One Up On Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3rEN9E9) by Peter Lynch

* This book emphasizes the advantages that individual investors hold over institutional investors (when it comes to finding investment opportunities). Lynch also gives many of examples of mistakes he has made, and how he has learned from them.

https://preview.redd.it/a3hze2lpng191.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=e94cbc8e20e50f7cd9b92a67c140952529bd0d04

&#x200B;

# [The Big Secret for the Small Investor](https://amzn.to/3fHyJ3I) by Joel Greenblatt

* Greenblatt explains why index funds can be better than actively managed funds. The big secret is maintaining a long term perspective!

https://preview.redd.it/qvhszg2qng191.png?width=347&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dc31f381276a372d5cb2eeb1c0afa91fb253454

&#x200B;

# [Winning on Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3rH4TyH) by Martin Zweig

* Zweig's success came from his ability to predict the bigger picture (such as trends in the broader market). The combination of his stock picking skill, general market understanding, and market timing, made him one of the great investors of stock market history. Zweig was more interested in growth than value. Unlike Buffett, Zweig isn't a 'buy and hold' investor. An AAII 8 year study of different strategies showed Zwieg's returning 1,659.3% from 1998-2005. He was #1 out of 56 others, including Buffett, Lynch, Fisher, O'Neal's CAN SLIM, Motley fools, and using ROE, P/E's etc. Second place was O'Neal's CAN SLIM with a 860% return.

&#x200B;

# [Irrational Exuberance](https://amzn.to/3mbTjKQ) by Robert Shiller

* Shiller makes strong argument that perfect market theory is flawed. The Idea of perfect market theory is basically that the markets are all knowing and completely rational, and in the long run can't be beat. Therefore , you can control costs with index funds and diversification. (You can't beat the market, therefore controlling costs and diversifying seems like logical strategy)

&#x200B;

# [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://amzn.to/3uaehfS)

* The key concepts of this book are risk tolerance, asset allocation, a balanced portfolio, tax efficiency and cash management. This book explains many of the pitfalls of investing. The Bogleheads and Jack Bogle preach the power of compound interest. Investing in low-fee index funds and holding them long-term is the method. This book gives an excellent, detailed rundown of how to implement this kind of investment plan.

https://preview.redd.it/mqmzqqerng191.png?width=335&format=png&auto=webp&s=942f56ed1175ccb9c7e5652f647b7ad24dd17228

&#x200B;

# [Common Sense Investing](https://amzn.to/3ucV0dW) by John Bogle

* Great information for anyone who is trying to make sense of personal finance and basic investments. This book explains why passive investing is a worry free, long-term strategy that consistency wins over time, and why active trading always returns to the mean.

https://preview.redd.it/h7aw2btrng191.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d706a714a567b2e59a27f840328cce4496408f0

&#x200B;

# [The Intelligent Investor](https://amzn.to/2PqdzMQ) by Benjamin Graham

* This is a great book for anyone who is interested in introducing themselves into the world of investing, or wants to get better at investing. This book gives lots of valuable information to help one understand the basics of value investing.

https://preview.redd.it/jux3a18sng191.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca28ae1e0affb69e1c1717da5d18b86660c4642

&#x200B;

# [The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need](https://amzn.to/3ugMSJu) by Andrew Tobias

* This is a book for people looking to learn the basics of investing and saving money

https://preview.redd.it/n8odacksng191.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b6ef78987fd43e278b18f267c8ce8621ef4d5f

&#x200B;

# [You Can Be a Stock Market Genius](https://amzn.to/3meewnv) by Joel Greenblatt

* This is not a book for beginners. Greenblatt gives a nice exposition of some more ""special situation"" investment styles & areas of equity investments (mergers, spin-offs, rights offerings, etc.)

https://preview.redd.it/mjm6kxzsng191.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=80d6fb469143339516c9012b6b7d60162ffab565"|1689766222.0

US stock futures inched higher in Friday morning trading as** tame inflation data gave hope to investors that the worst of inflation ‚Äî as well as the Federal Reserve‚Äôs tough stance on rate policy ‚Äî may be in the rearview mirror.

**S&P 500** \+0.14%  
**Dow** \+0.20%  
**Nasdaq** \-0.10%   


**üõí Consumer spending not going away**

**üìù Our report: Hold onto your wallets, folks! According to Goldman Sachs' chief economist, US ‚Äúexcess savings‚Äù might be shrinking, but that won't stop the spending party!** ""\[Excess savings are\] less necessary to get the consumer to continue growing consumption,"" Jan Hatzius explained during a recent media roundtable.  


 **üîë Key points:**  


* According to Hatzius, consumers needed their excess savings because real disposable income ‚Äî the income consumers see after adjusting for inflation ‚Äî was negative last year due to rising prices for goods and services
* Recent data has shown a cooling ‚Äî though still historically tight ‚Äî labor market, and inflation continuing to decelerate.
* The Goldman executive also said they see the probability of a recession in 2024 at just 15%  


**üí° So what:** Consumer spending plays a pivotal role in the U.S. economy, serving as a major driver of economic growth. The United States relies heavily on consumer spending to stimulate demand for goods and services, which, in turn, encourages business investment and job creation. When consumers are confident and spend more, businesses thrive, leading to increased production and employment.  


**üì± Apple works on making messaging to Android phones easier**

**WHAT: Apple is breaking up the texting party exclusivity!** Rumor has it that they're ready to mingle with Android, adopting a messaging standard for a smoother cross-platform texting experience. The company has been pushing back on the Rich Communication Services (RCS) standard for more than a year, even as Alphabet's Google and others have pressured the iPhone maker to adopt the technology,

**WHY:** The company said the new technology would work alongside iMessage and offer better interoperability than SMS or MMS.  


 **ü§ñ ChatGPT goes to school‚Ä¶**

**WHAT: OpenAI, the brainiacs behind the AI wizardry, are cooking up a plan to sneak ChatGPT into classrooms.** OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap, said at a conference in San Francisco that the company will form a team to explore educational applications for the technology.

**WHY:** Backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft, OpenAI kicked off the generative AI craze last November by releasing its ChatGPT chatbot, which became one of the world's fastest-growing applications.  


**ü™ß Now you can buy cars on Amazon!**

**WHAT: Buckle up, folks! Amazon is revving its e-commerce engine, and soon you'll be able to snag a sleek Hyundai ride!** Customers will be able to shop for, equip and buy a car on Amazon and schedule delivery through a local Hyundai dealer, the companies said.

**WHY:** The agreement is an expansion of a deal announced two years ago to expand Hyundai's digital showroom on Amazon, enabling customers to configure a vehicle, calculate the price and locate a dealer to complete the sale.

Briefly maxed it out and paid it back down in 2021. So about two years without use. We don‚Äôt live near Home Depot anymore and are trying to get better control of our debt. Home Depot sent us a letter recently saying if we don‚Äôt buy anything with the card the account will die. My wife wants to go shopping spree so we can keep it active. I rather it die . We have two credit cards left . In the last 5 years we paid off two cars, new purple bed , and two other credit cards off entirely. The two remaining credit cards are big so it will take a few years to pay off. We also got student loans to pay off . Her student loan is on pause because the school shut down for fraud and she applied for forgiveness which is pending.

**üîã US to spend billions to boost battery production**

**üìù Our report: The U.S. Department of Energy just threw $3.5 billion into the ring to amp up the nation‚Äôs battery game.** The funding, part of the infrastructure law signed off by President Joe Biden in 2021, comes as the Energy Department takes steps to boost U.S. battery manufacturing and next-generation battery research.

&#x200B;

 **üîë Key points:**

* The funding aims to boost battery manufacturing and supply chains by expanding domestic facilities for critical minerals, next-generation technologies and lithium-based technologies, among others.
* According to U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, the investment will place the US ‚Äúfront and center to meet the growing demand for advanced batteries, boost our global competitiveness, maintain and create good-paying jobs, and strengthen our clean energy economy‚Äù
* China dominates the global EV battery supply chain, and the limit it imposed on the anode material graphite in October has fueled uncertainty in the segment

**üí° So what:** Investing in battery technology is crucial for the U.S. for several reasons. As the U.S. transitions to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, efficient energy storage becomes vital to manage intermittent power generation. Batteries help store excess energy when it's available and release it when needed. Also ,the future of transportation is electric, and batteries are the heart of electric vehicles. A robust battery infrastructure supports the growth of the EV market, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and lowering emissions  


**ü§ñ Microsoft enters AI chip race**

**WHAT: Microsoft just pulled a chip out of its tech wizard hat!** At its Ignite developer conference in Seattle, the company introduced a new chip, called Maia, to speed up AI computing tasks and provide a foundation for its $30-a-month ""Copilot"" service for business software users, as well as for developers who want to make custom AI services.

**WHY:** Microsoft and other tech giants such as Alphabet are grappling with the high cost of delivering AI services, which can be 10 times greater than for traditional services such as search engines.  


**üí∞ IMF head encourages push for digital currencies**

**WHAT: Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva is urging countries to level up and get in on the central bank digital currency (CBDC) game.** Eleven countries, including a number in the Caribbean, and Nigeria, have already launched CBDCs.

**WHY:** Supporters say CBDCs will modernise payments with new functionality and provide an alternative to physical cash, which seems in terminal decline. Georgieva said that with technology advancing so rapidly, countries needed to push ahead with development now to avoid getting caught out in future.  


**ü™ß Meta fights back against EU designation**

**WHAT: Meta Platforms is raising its digital shield in protest against the European Union's ""gatekeeper"" label,** the first Big Tech company to challenge new EU rules setting out do‚Äôs and don'ts for the online services.

**WHY:** Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Marketplace, and WhatsApp qualified as gatekeepers under the DMA, which was designed to level the playing field between Big Tech companies and smaller competitors.

14|If you're a business owner, you can pay your children $13,850 (tax-free) and deduct it from your own taxes (legally). Here's how:|554|17vbwh9|FluentInFinance|https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/17vbwh9/if_youre_a_business_owner_you_can_pay_your/|182|"If you're a business owner, you can pay your children $13,850 (tax-free) and deduct it from your own taxes (legally).

By doing this, you can legally reduce your taxable income by $13,850 and avoid paying tax on that amount, plus your child will owe $0 taxes on that amount, and you can also invest $6,500 of that in a tax-free Roth IRA. (When you employ your children it‚Äôs s a business expense and business expenses are tax-deductible).

To avoid self-employment tax (15.3%), you can put your child on payroll and issue a W-2, then use the standard deduction to reduce their taxable income. (Children under 18 who work for a business owned by their parents are also exempt from paying Social Security and Medicare taxes).

You need to pay your children a reasonable wage for the work they do, and they have to perform an actual task (so create a contract detailing the responsibilities). Children can perform tasks such as administrative work, social media management, or other age-appropriate responsibilities (and make sure you track the hours worked). 

Your child has to be paid an age-appropriate reasonable wage. For example, it‚Äôs considered tax evasion if you pay a 1-year-old child $13,850 per year to do your accounting. 

When you pay your child for their work it‚Äôs considered a business expense and you can deduct it from your taxable income, lowering your tax liability. 

This strategy not only benefits you but also helps your child start their retirement savings early. You can make your child a millionaire by opening a custodial Roth IRA. By investing $6,500 in an S&P 500 index fund, it can grow tax-free. Here is an example: 

‚Ä¢ Invest $11 a day into an S&P 500 index fund 

‚Ä¢ Let compound interest do all the work 

‚Ä¢ In 30 years should have $1,002,208, tax-free (historically, the S&P 500 has earned 11% per year, on average, over the last 96 years) 

Based on an 11% average historical return, here is the power of compound interest and maxing out a Roth IRA: 

‚Ä¢ 10 Years: $117,369 

‚Ä¢ 20 Years: $433,591 

‚Ä¢ 30 Years: $1,331,479 

‚Ä¢ 40 Years: $3,880,962 

‚Ä¢ 50 Years: $11,120,016 

Because Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, your investments can compound and grow faster. With a ROTH IRA, you can withdraw your contributions at any time.

Hiring your children for your business (or side hustle) and investing their salary in a tax-free Roth IRA is a great strategy to save you money on taxes, help your child build wealth, and teach your child valuable skills. Your children will learn about budgeting, saving, and investing, all while earning money for themselves. Please remember: 

‚Ä¢ Track the hours worked 

‚Ä¢ Your child has to perform an actual task 

‚Ä¢ Check your state requirements for age 

‚Ä¢ Create a contract detailing the responsibilities 

‚Ä¢ Your child has to be paid an age-appropriate reasonable wage 

Taxes are your biggest expense in life so strategic tax planning is a must.

US stock futures ticked higher in Wednesday morning trading as** investors digested news of a tame inflation print.

**S&P 500** \+0.43%  
**Dow** \+0.34%  
**Nasdaq** \+0.60%   


**üìâ Inflation comes in cooler than expected**

**üìù Our report: In October, the sizzle in US consumer prices took a chill pill, thanks to cheaper gas and a more laid-back pace in housing cost hikes.** The annual rate of inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ‚Äì which tracks the cost of a basket of goods and services ‚Äì slowed to 3.2% last month, lower than the 3.7% reading in September and the coolest rate since July. 

 **üîë Key points:**  


* **The so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy costs, increased 0.2% from September, according to government figures.**
* **Despite some bumps in recent months, inflation has settled substantially from a 40-year high reached last year**
* **The Bureau of Labor Statistics figures reflected increases in rent and personal-care products and services, as well as health insurance due to a methodological change in how the government calculates it. Meanwhile, airfares and used-car prices declined.**

**üí° So what:** Declining inflation can have several benefits for the US economy. As prices stabilize, individuals can sufficiently adjust and support their cost of living, investor confidence is bolstered and there‚Äôs reduced uncertainty about the overall trajectory of the economy.  


**üö¥üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è UK lays down law on food delivery apps**

**WHAT: The UK's food delivery apps‚ÄîUber Eats, Deliveroo, and Just Eat‚Äîgot a stern memo from the interior ministry: ""No more sneaky account swaps, folks!""** Food delivery companies make initial checks on those who want to work for them, ensuring their age and their legal right to work in Britain. But once approved, the rider can sub-contract their accounts to others, who have not been checked.

**WHY:** ""Unchecked account sharing places the public at risk, enables - and therefore encourages - illegal migration, and leads to the exploitation of workers,"" Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said in a statement after he met the three companies.  


**üõçÔ∏è Amazon, Snapchat ink ad deal**

**WHAT: Amazon is taking online shopping to the next level, teaming up with Snapchat to let users in the U.S. buy goodies directly from the app.** Potential buyers would also be able to see real-time pricing, Prime eligibility, delivery estimates and product details on select Amazon product ads in Snapchat

**WHY:** Amazon also has similar tie-ups with Facebook-owner Meta Platforms and Pinterest. Its partnership could help aid a recovery in the advertising business of Snap, which reported better-than-expected earnings last month.  


**ü§ñ YouTube to roll out new AI rules**

**WHAT: YouTube is getting serious about AI tricks!** The company is rolling out new rules for AI content, including a requirement that creators reveal whether they've used generative artificial intelligence to make realistic looking videos. Accounts that fail to comply risk being suspended the streaming giant said.

**1)** A company in the U.S. sets up a subsidiary in a country with low or no taxes, like the Cayman Islands.

**2)** The subsidiary owns things the parent company needs, like intellectual property or trademarks.

**3)** The subsidiary charges the parent company licensing fees to use that intellectual property.

&#x200B;

Here is an example. Company X will shift its earnings somewhere else to avoid the U.S. corporate tax rate:

**A)** U.S. company makes $50 billion profit. But it owes its Cayman Islands subsidiary, Company Y, $50 billion in licensing fees (for the intellectual property (IP) that Company X needs to use).

**B)** Company Y charges Company X $50 billion for the IP license, resulting in Company X's profit becoming $0. Now the U.S parent company, Company X, has zero profit and pays zero taxes.

**C)** Company Y books the $50 billion profit but pays near zero taxes because of the Cayman's tax laws.
