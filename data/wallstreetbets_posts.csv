Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

**I. Intro**

Hello degenerates! Not financial advice, I am a retarded degenerate too. 

*TMC, OPAD, and IRNT were supposed to go to the fucking moon, right? Why the hell didn’t they? Because you have an obsession with OTM call options.* 

First off, answer this question for me: Which call option strikes have the highest gamma? Go ahead, I’m sure you YOLOing mother fuckers know that before you drop your 100k on **GAMMA** SQUEEZE, right?

Here’s some pictures I drew on to help you. These are the option chains for each of last week’s favorites. I’ll highlight the call strike that has the highest gamma. 

**TLDR in section III.**

&#x200B;

[  The Iron Giant – You degenerates saw $100 a share everywhere and really went for it. Look at all that open interest at $40. Those MFers were expensive. Look at that, by the end of Friday they only had a delta of 3.1, so about 3 shares hedged for each of those calls. Ouch. ](https://preview.redd.it/fj133ltavho71.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3ae7fd171c61e4100e0aeb113bf72c50daac486)

&#x200B;

[ What strikes? First one in the money, first one out of the money. OPA! ](https://preview.redd.it/45jh9ltavho71.jpg?width=1157&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28c0ffc619e959f76906068314dc368ee61b46d8)

&#x200B;

[  TMC – You were supposed to be the chosen one! 160&#37; short interest, massive gamma, low share price.](https://preview.redd.it/ijhuhjtavho71.jpg?width=1190&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ebdc63c195aa7749527ef0728e50a24858c654d)

&#x200B;

But wait a second, doesn’t gamma move with the stock? Absolutely. And now we learn HOW to gamma.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**II. Buying ATM options is to Gamma Squeezes as Buying and Holding Shares is to Short Squeezes**

So now you know, the highest gamma is the first strike in the money, and first strike out of the money. What does this mean, and why is this the highest gamma position?

A gamma squeeze is essentially taking advantage of market maker delta hedging. The “idea” here is that there is a rush to own shares in large lots as the price moves. The whole purpose of buying a call option is to lock in a price to own 100 shares. It’s an insurance package. If you are buying at the money options, your breakeven price is pretty close to, but just a bit higher than the share price, depending on volatility (vega gang). 

The *implied* sentiment behind buying at the money options is that you are expecting a continued rise in share price. If you were to go further in the money, you are expecting the share price to remain the same (break even = share price). If you go out of the money, you’re expecting a miracle and want to donate money to the market maker’s party fund. 

So what this means for a gamma squeeze, is that in order for it continue, option buying must reflect an *implied sentiment of continued rise in share price*. 

&#x200B;

**III.** **If I want to squeeze the gamma, how do I get the juice? READ THIS IT’S YOUR TL;DR**

**SMALL LOTS at a time,**  **BUY FIRST STRIKE IN THE MONEY – SELL OFF 90% WHEN 5+ strikes ITM and buy more ATM**

Buy the first strike in the money, every time. It doesn’t matter the share price. If you are expecting a gamma squeeze, always buy the first strike in the money, or if you’re really a damn cheapskate, get the first one out of the money.

When the share price rises and puts your call a strike or two in the money, buy another small lot at the money again. Continue to do this.   
 Now once the share price puts your calls 5+ strikes in the money, sell dem bitches and get more AT THE MONEY. The gamma on the calls deep in the money has played out. 

In the money calls have a maximum delta of 100. If you can sell an in the money call, and buy two at the money calls with a delta of 60, now you are effecting a combined delta of 120 on the stock. Your power is growing and the market makers must now hedge even more delta. 

Let’s look at IRNT for next week. Do you know what you nitwits have done? You’ve opened up massive open interest far out of the money and there’s almost ZERO in the money calls open. You want a gamma squeeze you’re gonna have to get sell off those OTM options and buy at the money. I promise you, the share price will not reach your $70 strike option without significant buy volume. The market makers are bringing the majority of the volume as they delta hedge, and they’re not going to hedge all those calls that are $40 out of the money. There’s zero reason to. In fact, as we approach expiration, their delta gets LOWER and shares are SOLD by market makers. Don’t shoot yourself in the foot!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Okay, you've already shot yourselves in the foot, but maybe it can be fixed?](https://preview.redd.it/pvho43sqvho71.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90a98487e6213179783b1f1c1cd7e61c5c762792)

  

Alright, so repeat after me, for a GAMMA squeeze, you buy options with the HIGHEST GAMMA. Which ones are they? First strike in the money, first strike out of the money. 

&#x200B;

SDC has had a 9.54% increase in short ratio in a week's span. With approximately 5.67 days to cover, this is considered *extremely difficult* due to the limited timeline and increase in CTB. *This means they are obligated to cover their shares this week.*

&#x200B;

**Bollinger Band Chart**

“After a period of consolidation, the price often makes a larger move in either direction, ideally on high volume. Expanding volume on a breakout is a sign that traders are voting with their money that the price will continue to move in the breakout direction.”

As you can see, the Bollinger Bands can provide use for determining volatility movements. The arrows point at narrow action.

[Bollinger Band Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/9o6wfrf6oio71.jpg?width=623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a47e52e8a8fec0f349e1a46179b73ed01a837cb)

**In short:**

In typical movements, the bands keep a safe distance.

In volatile movements, the bands can become narrow; moving closer towards the middle band, or SMA.

**If you’re too retarded to understand, this means that narrow=tendiez.**

The final detail to this chart is the occurrence of ovals. Upright ovals have signaled an uptrend, while downright ovals signal a downtrend.

*Not even after a full 24 hours, we saw 2 oval occurrences that led to an uptrend.*

&#x200B;

**Predictions:**

[Consolidation to a Breakout](https://preview.redd.it/jrp9iahaoio71.jpg?width=622&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=329ce2ff67ebddc77cc19e4c0727e18e7084186a)

9/17/21 AH Bollinger has become narrow.. **We have yet again, another opportunity to catch hedge funds with their dicks out.**

I have highlighted the narrow occurrences with a white rectangle; I have also indicated the consolidation in price action with purple crayon. The rectangle on the right is capturing a potential uptrend, one that can EXCEED the resistance of $7.41. Since the stock has consolidated at a higher price, it’s only logical to hypothesize a spike greater than before.

CTB is also steadily increasing which means that they are willingly spending more to cover their position. The fact is, they are losing- and doing whatever is possible to stay afloat.

&#x200B;

**What happened here?**

[They got scared](https://preview.redd.it/6pi21ghfoio71.jpg?width=623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=806a9502c1972d99cd7ac372925e195e1c763553)

Our support is $6.36 while our resistance is $7.41. Obviously, a massive sell wall is what prevented us from rallying further. Again, we have another opportunity.

&#x200B;

**Bollinger Bandwidth: Measures distance between Bollinger Bands.**

Low BBW= squeeze indication

High BBW= no squeeze indication.

**September 17:** We saw the **BBW (Yes, Big Beautiful Women)**, drop beneath .05. Then, the price action got hard as fuck.

**How many of you idiots got laid last night? How about this week? Oh, none? Maybe if you actually grew some balls and didn’t have scared money you’d actually get some bitches on your dick.**

Now, we are at another point in time where the BBW is beneath .05. It’s self-explanatory what will happen next. Will you continue to sit with your dick flaccid or will you hop in and get some action?

&#x200B;

 **Align Technology is SDC's competitor. Their EPS is over $700. They share the same manufacturer for fucks sake. SDC is extremely undervalued and will be a long term hold.**

10|$ASTS, tomorrow plan/an update and my positions cuz people kept asking|179|prhz04|wallstreetbets|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prhz04/asts_tomorrow_planan_update_and_my_positions_cuz/|66|"first off, we closed wonderfully last Friday, could have been better without a doubt but it was still pretty good. this is a breakout confirmation imo, we see a bull flag and a reverse head shoulder overlapping then we see a green dildo with large volume. this is by the books, a break out. could it be a fake out? yes, could it go sideways for the next 10 years? yes. but probability right now favors a continuation as the patterns shall play out in my opinion. the blue lines are bull flag and its target, the green is the reverse head shoulder pattern with the black lines representing its measured target. we can see an overlap between the two patterns targets and the gap on the daily chart, if we go to the weekly this overlaps with the weekly pivot as well. this price target is roughly $16-$17 but id sell at $15.99 personally. we do have some resistance around $14 as we could reach it, get rejected and then go down to $12.5-$13 support, scenario 2 is that we hit $14 then we get rejected into oblivion, scenario 3, we never hit $14 and lastly scenario miracle, we never get rejected from $14 and head straight to the price target. as a trader personally id be trying to make best judgement on the spot but things move too fast and theres risks associated with trading so ill leave it here and the choice is yours. My first red flag would be if we broke 12.5, the second is if we go below 11.70 roughly and then ill pull the plug. we didnt close above the pivot on the weekly which isnt the end of the world though it would've made my dick hard if we did, i believe the candle stick pattern were seeing is bullish on the weekly and indicative of a continuation. im not here shilling the moon or $50 PT in the next 20minutes with a $69 PT by monday and $420 PT on tuesday whopped out from thin air, just a chart, easy and simple. 

&#x200B;

Now if i see a rocket launching of 30% or more, ill be selling regardless of price. im taking profit and not leaving much room for regret unless some news comes out, this especially applies towards the open when we might see some shorts and option sellers cover. i could give zero fucks about the fundamentals, options chain, and squeezes. this is a trade based off charts and patterns not magic crystal balls. it can fail or it can succeed. i got a great entry which i mentioned in my first technical analysis post during the AH, my risk is pretty low and reward is pretty high.

lastly my positions, people thought i was lying and just tryna do a pump and dump so heres the proof. My rebound post was intended for people who were holding and scared due to the early day dump and quite frankly the price did bounce and a contribution supporting all the DD i saw cuz i wouldn't have noticed this stock/chart otherwise. granted there are a bunch of bag holders so they should just consider themselves lucky that the chart was painted very nicely. This is not financial advice, I have 4 mental illnesses (that i know of) and just tryna boost my self esteem by successfully earning money while gaining some good karma (not reddit karma lol, actual karma) cuz i need a whole lot of it for my medical school app.

In one day the share price peaked from $4.73 to $9.79. Buyers refused to listen bears explaining that the 5.6 billion share count was too high to move $NOK. Instead they kept buying hitting 1.2 billion volume in a day before trading was halted.

&#x200B;

**Global leader in 5G networks**

To keep it short Nokia is currently a network company. Main competitors being Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung. You can still buy Nokia branded mobile phones and other products under their licensing agreements, but the core is in the networks (fixed and wireless). Heart of the R&D is an iconic Bell Labs. Key words to current Nokia are 5G, edge cloud, AI, IoT etc.

&#x200B;

**Share count vs Market cap**

Nokia share count is 5.6 billion and market cap $31 billion (9/17/2021). During the meme action people figured out that the market cap 26.4 billion in January is what really counts, and this proofed to be right. It really doesn't matter if there are 5.6 billion shares at the price of $4.73 or 1.12 B shares with the price of $23.65 - exactly the same market cap.

As a comparison this year $GME and $AMC market caps peaked $37.3 B and $36.9 B respectively. However, $NOK didn't have a huge short position for leverage but instead it was and still is a value play with EUR 3.7 billion net cash and solid profitable cashflow. It is an undervalued quality stock in the blink of a turnaround. To give some perspective Nokia market cap was in January 2021 one tenth of Cisco's.

&#x200B;

**Renewed product portfolio is second to none in the industry**

Let's face it, Nokia had problems with 5G product portfolio development after it acquired Alcatel Lucent in 2016. Company simply didn't have enough resources to focus on 5G product line while they were busy to merge ALU and Nokia 4G product portfolios. So, they ended up taking a shortcut by using programmable FPGA chips in their products instead of more efficient and cost friendly SoC chips.

Eventually Nokia focused to SoCs in 2019 and it took two years to catch the competition with new Reefshark based products using SoCs. In July 2021 the huge workload was pretty much done and at the end of this year over 70% of shipped products will be based on SoC's and the new deals will be more or less all part of the renewed product portfolio.

Now that Nokia has catched up the gap to the competitors in product competitiveness it is adding even more firepower to the R&D efforts which can be seen as a good sign. Main target is to be the best network company in the industry and according to the management we will see some new exciting product launches still in this year.

&#x200B;

**Main competitor still banned by US government**

US has been accusing Huawei about close connections to Chinese communist party and sees it as a possible security threat. Therefore, it has been warning other countries to avoid using its products and about a year ago even banned Huawei to buy much needed 5G chips. Naturally the company bought as many chips to stock as it could but it’s now running out of parts (much worse situation compared to January 2021).

Their mobile handset business is currently sinking (no new 5G phones at all), and it seems that for base stations it must start using less sophisticated and more energy consuming components manufactured by Chinese suppliers. So, they will be able to deliver products but at what cost?

There have been articles stating that Chinese government should compensate energy costs to operators in order to make the new products more appealing. Pretty much the same strategical approach which Huawei has been successfully using in the past decade stealing market share from Nokia and Ericsson by selling products even under the price of components. All this has been possible because Chinese government has been subsidizing the company generously. Sad side effect has been that even there are a handful network providers left in the industry it has been hard to make any profit. Now it seems that US ban is changing the game and market share is flooding to western rivals which can start raising their prices and margins to reasonable levels.

&#x200B;

Overall the global situation is much different than it was a couple of years ago. It’s too risky for operators to focus purely on buying less secure underpriced Chinese products as their own government or consumers might turn against them. For operators it’s more important to do business with reliable and ethical partners. Nokia is a good choice as it has been named by Ethisphere as one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies.

&#x200B;

**Competent management with can do attitude**

Pekka Lundmark is the current CEO following Stephen Elop and Rajeev Suri. He did a much-needed strategy review in the company about a year ago and since then the progress has been convincing. Nokia buried its end to end strategy, business unit heads are now fully responsible of profit & loss and the decision making is not anymore scattered around the organization. All businesses are seeing growth and the change is already visible in the financial numbers even the three-year strategy execution is only in its first phase.

Pekka has also totally changed the company's comms policy. Nowadays Nokia is very transparent with its comms. It prefer to set lower targets and give surprise profit raises instead of promising the moon from the sky in the first place. The new policy might seem pessimistic to some but to be honest the overpromising strategy didn’t work well either and shareholders along with analysts lost the faith to the company. We might argue that the current undervaluation is indirect consequence of bad comms and it simply takes a few solid quarters to convince otherwise.

&#x200B;

**COVID and future technologies supporting 5G ímplementation**

COVID boosted the network usage globally and we are seeing growing demand for better networks with higher capacity and lower latencies. However, behind the scenes there is much more happening. Companies and research labs are inventing killer apps and products to best use 5G networks. For example, VR and AR could potentially be something to wait for.

Big problems with VR/AR have been the storage, power consumption, and processing power. 5G will solve the problems by pushing these  away from the PC and into the edge cloud. Imagine the next Facebook where people will get a totally new sense of immersion with VR/AR. When this happen the consumers and companies will be begging for growing 5G availability with more bandwidth and lower latency capabilities.

Private wireless use cases and smart city solutions are key parts to lead the next technological revolution with significant productivity gains and will grow the demand for high quality networks. Lufthansa, many ports and mining companies are already taking advantage of early wins to beat the competition.

Oh boy, oh boy when the first significant use cases for masses pop up. The demand for high speed networks will skyrocket and I bet that the few relevant network companies will not sell their products and services cheap now that Chinese are not anymore disrupting the markets.

&#x200B;

**What analysts are saying?**

Analysts focusing on the company are much more optimistic than the market currently. End of July Goldman Sachs raised their target to 6.10 EUR.

&#x200B;

Closing price (September 17): **$5.50** (4.70 EUR)

Target price: High $8.27, Median **$7.12**, Low $5.75

Buy: **17**, Overweight: **3**, Hold: **9**, Sell: **0**

&#x200B;

**Peculiar trading activity this week**

Nokia stock has been arrogantly used to rinse option players every now and then by market players. It seems that max pain levels for option players have been reached time and again. Actually, this happened past weeks as well when the share price was pushed from $6.29 (peak after Nokia raised their guidance for 2021) to $5.50 without any negative news. Someone adjusted the robots well as the closing price on Friday was precisely $5.50 (maximum gains for bankers). Only medicine to stop this kind of activity would be to grow the faithful owner base so it would be more difficult for market player to move the share price. Eventhough in the longrun these kind of short-term movements are meaningless.

With these levels, next week will be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors who see the underlying potential in this hidden gem. Not even meme phenomenon is needed to reach the double digits in $NOK share price in the coming years.

Disclaimer. I’m long-term Nokia owner with solid position of shares (9/17/2021 -> up +10%, YTD +49,13 %). I see the stock as a great value play in a long run but I’m not a financial advisor so buy with your own risk."|1632076140.0

There are ~30 *major* China property companies. Guangzhou R&F has the most leverage. Actually, of the China government's 3 ""red lines"", G R&F is the worst off. 

These are the CCP's policies. Evergrande can *still* increase debt by +5%

How did Evergrande get into this position? Due to my former life as a equities PM, I've been investing in China property for 13 years. 

Evergrande diversified into non-core businesses, like healthcare, water, sports, tech. They've had the among the higest debt for *many* years.

Why is it being singled out by the media now?
Because while Guangzhou R&F, Greentown have higher debt, Evergrande's margins and profits are worst.

Also profits have fallen off the cliff  at -$1.2bn losses 1H'21. (vs -3% year-on-year growth estimated for the sector)

What happened in the past to high leverage property companies? They were quietly ""faded out"" to a non-event

1) Anbang - $310 bn assets including Waldorf Astoria (NY). Failed restructuring. China government seized control. $5bn valuation at the firesale, vs #Evergrande $4 bn now

2) HNA - purchased prized property assets in debt fueled growth,including investing in Hilton & as the top investor of Deutsche Bank. $200bn debt it couldn't pay. Chairmain Founder 'fell' and died on holiday

3) Dalian Wanda - China's largest mall developer, bought Atletico Madrid & AMC. $6bn debt due 2020. Tycoon (former richest Asian) lost -$32bn salvaging the company

Moral of the story? Nothing dramatic happens. These companies get ""managed"".

In China, the largest banks are State Owned Enterprises. These issues are gradually resolved with moralsuasion or a phone call from the CCP.

In the West, the government doesn't have these ""one phonecall"" tools. This is what Western media doesn't grasp.

The CCP is extremely smart and will do anything to ensures social and financial stability.

Credit Market impact: As in the past, the CCP will ""manage"" the deleveraging process. Just like the media FUD on Anbang, HNA, Dalian Wanda -- likely no shock waves are going to happen in China's credit markets.

Final comment: I spoke to 2 Bloomberg reporters last week. Their bonu$ was dependent on how much their stories could impact a company's stock price. 

So don't believe everything you read.

Technicals Included.|69|prh48p|wallstreetbets|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prh48p/irnt_the_dd_to_know_going_into_next_week/|81|"So, there's a lot of confusion to $IRNT and I want to provide my perspective. I'm not a professional trader or anything like that.

$IRNT rose based on a few important things. The company itself, Super 8-K Redemption, Option Chain activity, CTB%, and Short Interest, as well as the traction it attracted.

**The company**: They're a Cyber Security Solutions enterprise. Their investment partners are Kleiner Perkins, CS Capital, and ForgePoint Capital. ([here](https://www.ironnet.com/company/about)) Their partners are Microsoft, AWS, CROWDSTRIKE, DomainTools, NUTANIX, Cortex XSoar, Paloalto, IBM Radar, Splunk, Splunk Soar, and SWIMLANE. ([Here](https://www.ironnet.com/company/partners/technology-partners)).

**Quick Summary for this quarter**:

* Solutions provider for cyber attacks, IronNet Cybersecurity (NYSE:IRNT)FQ2 revenue jumped 23% to $6.1M, subscription revenue grew to $5.8M vs. $5.3M last year.
* Annual Recurring Revenue (or ARR): $24.1M vs. $19.5M prior.
* Customer Count: 51 compared to 22 last year.
* Operating loss of $17M compared to $14.2M.
* Net loss: $17.2M compared to $14.3M.
* Cash and cash equivalents: $14.1M.
* **Outlook**: “Our cloud-based subscription revenue -- which grew to 60% of product revenue in the first half of the year, a 65% year-over-year growth rate -- is a strong proof point for the business and underscores the fully recurring aspect of our financial model. Our cloud focus coupled with the large deal formation that we are seeing reflects IronNet’s ease of deployment and increasing market recognition, which keeps us on pace to double ARR in the third quarter and meet our growth objectives for the full year.” said James Gerber, CFO.
* **FY Guidance**: Revenue of $43M-45M; ARR of $75M as of end of the fiscal year.
* The stock has a market cap of $1.64B and has seen a jump in price of \~19% over the last five trading days.
* Recent bullish rating on the stock by contributor who writes, 'IronNet Is Extremely Undervalued At $20'
* Previously (Sept. 14): IronNet misses on revenue
* Shares jump \~14% during pre-market hours.

**The Public Float**:

Regarding the [Super 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-263381/), this has reduced the float to anywhere between 1.3M to 6M. Additional, [8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-272930/) before Super 8-K filing for those who like to read these.

It's looking like the float is realistically between 2.7M - 3.5M. Extremely low and the reason why it moves so easily. Looks like on Friday the shorts and MM won that battle. SI% actually increased on Friday and every Call Above $30.00 was OTM and was definitely mostly written by MM's.

Here's the **Option Chain** for October 15th:

[Option Activity for Oct. 15th](https://preview.redd.it/7vo75izu3jo71.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bcdbf55d6840ea2e839d1a5412046c0e83fa15f)

**Short Interest & CTB%**:

Short Interest was at 58% of the float before Friday, and the shorts have actually increased on Friday. Also, I can't access Ortex but I saw a video today of someone looking it up and saw the increase. Anyone with access to confirm on Monday would be great. Don't forget to use the shares amount shorted and divide by the current float.

The CTB% is above 500% this is from iborrowdesk. I know some will debate data etc, but even if you cut that in half thats still outrageous.

[IBorrowDesk](https://preview.redd.it/nl2z9cjx3jo71.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=c482c55c65282bd5a7d19c17e4b481c2a535e5e8)

When the weeks start and more data is published this will need to be monitored.

**Technicals**:

First off, the Fibonacci Retracement (5 day, 5 Min):

[Fibonacci Retracement \(5 Day, 5 Min\)](https://preview.redd.it/lohhsia40ko71.jpg?width=1834&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f530524a5595f76e317f2269c4389aa437a7d6d)

You can also see my entry position with the green arrow. If this picture is too blurry, the support/resistances are $19.24, $27.11, $33.29, $37.63, $41.97, $47.34, and $56.06.

Started the line with the lowest point before September 14th. These are levels to check throughout the week and especially Monday and Tuesday. We're looking to support at $33.39. If we can maintain support above $27.11 and support strong resistance that'll be positive, if we break $27.11, the next resistance line is $19.24. This is were things can get weary as this can be a sign of a negative trend. Good thing is this company seems rock solid, and is being evaluated at <$20.00. But keep this in mind.

Looking to see if a Cup and Handle will form:

[Cup and Handle Example](https://preview.redd.it/gbv44fw24jo71.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=823caf5853fd090c12099c1893b43b063a39ff2c)

MACD:

RSI:

[RSI: \(Close,5\) - $45.32, Oversold @ below $30.00, Overbought above $70.15, per RSI, 5 Day.](https://preview.redd.it/v5i8gug74jo71.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=d97db747278fb821a8b671afe84cea202e05894e)

This is also a stock that is trending heavily, so, technicals can't be completely relied on. Only next week will determine that.

**Google Trends**:

&#x200B;

[7 Day Trend, Friday is still highly trending, the flat line is beacause of the weekend.](https://preview.redd.it/ad2upoca4jo71.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfa2a677644ee0e7d378f8a4af5bcc01aad9cb79)

&#x200B;

[30 Day Trend](https://preview.redd.it/dcjxb0cc4jo71.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=d00ba95bfb1c9aa6e79a0eb1c3c33bea0a41a9d0)

With this stock closing at $30, if we test support we can very much expect bullish sentiments. If over the next few days support isn't being tested, then supports become resistance.

This stock is highly shorted, has a very large ITM Option Activity, very small float, and a high CTB%.

I think there's a lot that can come out of this stock, but also if the interest isn't there then probably not. Thing about this stock though is retail owns and can own the float until any PIPE lock ups expire.

That's something else that will be important to follow are the SEC filings for the lock ups.

Overall, this seems to be a solid company with a lot of growth up ahead.

""Its annual recurring revenue also noted a year-over-year growth in the recent quarter to **$24.1 million**. For the full financial year, IronNet now forecasts $75 million of ARR on up to $45 million in revenue."" As of 3 days ago.

I'm not a professional trader what's so ever, I ordered Wendy's for supper. I have no idea where this could go, it really depends on a variety of factors but it's worth watching going into next week and October.

24|Some common mistakes we seem to make and how not to repeat them [Long post for newbies]|15|prnoeo|wallstreetbets|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prnoeo/some_common_mistakes_we_seem_to_make_and_how_not/|13|"Hello! I am mostly a lurker in here but I do post time to time. And recently, I am seeing an influx of bad rumours or advice that seems to be constantly circling around. So, I hope this post might be helpful for those that are kinda new into degen gambling.

*if you are already an experienced trader, ignore this post.*

Now, here's some common mistakes or rumours or bad advice that's circling around in reddit:

* Everything is not a short squeeze. Seriously. I have seen people claiming stocks like PLTR, SPY etc is short squeeze. It is not. There are very specific criteria that makes things a short squeeze, and without understanding that, you might lose money thinking that everything is a short squeeze.   


1. Most of the time, when some redditor is claiming a short squeeze, it's probably just that that person wants everyone to pile into that stock so that their options/stocks gain value and could make a quick exit. So, the intention is to create a pump and dump scheme. You may make money if you are early, but most likely you are not early at all.

[Short squeeze](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

Also, do understand that if someone says hedgies are manipulating the market or things like that, be very sceptical. Are you sure that the person saying that isn't manipulating you? Are you sure that the person saying that is not some fund manager/high net worth individual influencing you to buy some shitty options that they want to sell?

Market is influenced/manipulated by everything. Your buying and selling is also a form of manipulation. So understand this, don't fall for ""Hedgies manipulating this stock, if you buy it, you will stick it to the hedgies"" narrative.

We are here to make money through short term positions, not to be manipulated by some idealistic rant.

&#x200B;

* Everything is not a gamma squeeze. I saw a post today about Gamma squeeze, and that's what made me write this post.

[Here's the link to that wsb post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prcdnr/why_you_suck_ass_at_gamma_squeezing_and_what_you/)

[What is Gamma?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp) I think if you follow this investopedia article and read through the various links linked there, you will under pretty easily.

&#x200B;

* Understand the basics of options, seriously, you don't even know what an options chain is (that happene), yet you are throwing money at some random redditors words, that's just bad for your financial health. Seriously. **You shouldn't touch options until you realise what you are doing. If you lose money after you realise what you are doing, well, that's all right.**

You will find plenty of free materials online that might help you with it. If I were to give you a suggestion about a book, well, ""Option volatility and pricing strategies"" by Sheldon Natenberg may help you with it.

&#x200B;

* Puts are not bad and is not equivalent to burning money. Puts and swaps are instruments that could be really useful in a trading plan. Understand this. If buying puts is really equivalent to burning money, then why do all these huge investors do it? Because they are retarded? Not really.   
Why are puts generally more expensive than calls?

They work like insurance. If you are making 10% or maybe 500%😂 or maybe even more gains a year, it makes sense that you keep your wealth preserved. If someone is warning doom and gloom, you won't have to lose your sleep, because you know when the time comes, you won't be the  💼 holder.

&#x200B;

* Special dividend doesn't make a stock suddenly worth it to buy. I have seen some dumb plays being shared in wsb that company Something (I forgot the company ticker) is going to announce special dividend, so let's just buy the stock. Unless you can create such a hype that autists pile onto the stock for no reason, then special dividend suddenly doesn't really change things.

The market will adjust the amount of special dividend that will be given. An options seller will also adjust the price of the options that you are going to buy. So, special dividend is a zero sum game or a rather negative sum game, cause you might create a taxable event which could impact you in the future.

&#x200B;

* Bonds are not lame. It is an instrument that may not have its applicability in this sub, but to imply that anyone who buys bonds is burning money or to create false rumours to that extent is really misleading and I have seen lots of redditors imply this.

Did you know that up until 2020, long term treasury bonds outperformed S&P 500 (dividend inclusive) for the last 20 years before that? [Sauce](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html)

Although this trend will not be seen any time in the future any longer as bond yields are just too low. That's why we are finally seeing some inflows into stocks instead of outflows from it.

&#x200B;

* Understand the taxes that you might have to pay, before you gamble and use tax sheltering facilities that the government is providing you. I don't know if you are an US retard or not, but to my knowledge, most countries have some form of tax advantages or som schemes similar to that, use that to gamble your money.

Taxes have destroyed many a gamblers life. They won money in a play. Sold. Then lost all or some of it in another play, in some cases (not all), you might actually owe taxes to the tax authority that you don't even have.

This is a very country and individual circumstances specific thing, so I can't really tell you how best to save on taxes unless I know in detail about your circumstances. But for Americans hope this [will help start in your journey.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxshelter.asp)

Also, to add to this, I have seen probably some very dumb comments of people saying things like ""I would owe more taxes if I make more money that's why I am making less money"", don't be that guy.

&#x200B;

* Be sceptical. This is the best thing to understand. Even if you ignore all of my other points, don't ignore this, just be more sceptical. No one lost money by not entering a play. Someone is showing rocket emojis, dildos, some gibberish, drawing, meme etc to induce you to buy something, be sceptical. Why is that person pumping AAPL (although very few may have lost money in that), what is his motive? Why is he writing such a long essay on that particular stock? Ask questions. 

You should also ask the question why I am writing this? What's my motive? Etc etc.

&#x200B;

* Don't trust the comments, do your own DD. Seriously. You might see a lot of coordinated efforts if you really dig into some of the profiles.

&#x200B;

* Technical analysis is not astrology for men. While I don't use technical analysis much, technical analysis in its core, just shows you where the buyers and sellers are. And it can be helpful to enter and exit a trade.

Remember, for every time you are buying something, someone else is selling those something. Technical analysis can easily show you where buyer and sellers are meeting the most in a condensed format.

Understanding it might help you position, enter, exit and most importantly discipline your trades.

Does it mean that you should just follow the cup and handle pattern and buy things? No. It is a tool, much like every other tool a gambler can have in their belt.

&#x200B;

* CPI is not a sham. I have seen people claim general inflation has been 10% or whatever imaginary number for the last 2 decade and things like that. And I am unable to neither laugh nor react to it.

To understand CPI, you gotta understand the composition of the CPI.

Some say, CPI doesn't include housing consumption, which is laughable. [Here you will find CPI weights of each sector.](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf) The question if CPI includes hous or not is answered by this [paper](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/08/art1full.pdf) succinctly.

You might see people use a source like shadowstats, which is essentially a completely flawed website. Here's some reading [material.](https://www.thestreet.com/economonitor/emerging-markets/deconstructing-shadowstats-why-is-it-so-loved-by-its-followers-but-scorned-by-economists)

Yes, CPI has some flaws, but it is not a sham like people try to make it out to be. If inflation is really 10% or 8%, why are commercial banks lending money at such a low rate? Wouldn't they have become bankrupt within this 2 decade?? Better yet, if you really believe that inflation is something percent, put your money where your mouth is and buy up everything you see in Walmart and try to sell that 1 year later also using the low interest environment in your favour.

&#x200B;

*  I have seen many more rumours or other bogus claims but I feel like I should get some sleep, so I am stopping here. Other kind redditor may continue from here in the comments section. To give you some hints about some other false rumours, they are mostly about Chinese tech giants like Alibaba; about [quantitative easing and inflation  misconceptions](https://www.lynalden.com/inflation/) or even misconceptions about cry pto etc.

Hope this helps in clearing out some confusion and have a nice night. And if you have seen or know about some other mistakes or misconceptions people have, please do share!"|1632112398.0
