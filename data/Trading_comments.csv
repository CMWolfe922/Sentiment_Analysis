I am happy to announce that after almost 3 months of working up to this moment, I can now share that we have an ***official discord server*** for r/Trading!

Come on in, introduce yourself in *#introductions*, gather some roles like collectors items in *#role-assign* and sit down by the fire for some *#philosophy-table* discussion. Share some analysis in *#technical-analyis* and talk about your trades while they are happening, in *#trading-floor*. There is hopefully something for everyone in here, and I truly want to make it feel like a real community and a place you can all call home. I appreciate any feedback you may have on this, so feel free to let me know.

&#x200B;

We will also be hosting regular chess and poker tournaments, along with brainstorming sessions (hopefully weekly - reach out to @ Sedona in the discord) educational lectures etc. These will all be with the aim of improving one's trading abilities! There may be many more events in the future as well, and we would be very happy to take suggestions.

Medigus (MDGS) is Expanding its Horizons Through Tech Investments and Creating Potential Near Term Catalysts in the Process

Holding more than 18 patents. Multiple catalysts lining up and an Aegis analyst price target represents a 400% increase from the current $1.48 PPS.

July 26th, 2021 - [Medigus Board of Directors Decides to Promote a $2 Million Buyback Program](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medigus-board-directors-decides-promote-130000897.html)

July 30th, 2021 - [Medigus: Charging Robotics Successfully Completes a Proof of Concept for its Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging Robot](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medigus-charging-robotics-successfully-completes-114500829.html)

Initiating coverage on **Medigus Ltd. (NASDAQ: MDGS),** a technologies company that is focused on innovative growth partnerships, mainly in advanced medical solutions, digital commerce, and electric vehicle markets.

Current price $1.48/share

MDGS is a company with a lot of potential, and catalysts beginning to line up. MDGS has a diversified portfolio of tech investments, a modest share structure, an attractive entry share price and a strong financial position.

**Considerations for MDGS:**

Modest share structure with 23.8M shares outstanding and 23.6M in the public float. In June MDGS had $27M in cash and no debt beyond typical operating obligations.

The company shares seem priced at a value right now and are very close to their estimated book value of $1.45/share.

When I look at the [company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui), I notice that the share price just crossed its 20 SMA and is very close to crossing its 50 SMA of $1.53. This condition can signal a significant swing coming. I also note that the company shares are trading significantly off their recent levels (and 64% off the 52-week high).

**Products developed by Medigus:**

**ScoutCam** develops and manufactures the smallest cameras produced in the world, which are down to 1mm diameter including illumination. ScoutCam devices have been used across the medical, aerospace, industrial, research, and defense industries.

**The Medigus Ultrasonic Surgical Endostapler, or MUSE™ system**, is a comprehensive endoscopic device that incorporates the latest technological advancements to deliver a more patient-friendly option for Transoral Fundoplication (TF), the procedure is intended to treat the leading cause of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).

**MDGS has more than 18 patents registered in their portfolio around the world.**

**MDGS has investments/activity in over 9 businesses of which 3 are currently public companies traded on the TASE and the OTC Market and involved in these sectors:**

**Medical**

**Polyrizon Ltd**., a privately held company which Medigus owns 35.86% of its share capital, is evaluating the viral infection prophylaxis effect of its innovative product candidate against the Delta variant of the coronavirus (lineage B.1.617.2), in-vitro. This study follows recent pre-clinical studies showed strong potential against human coronavirus 229E and influenza virus infection.

**Electric Vehicles**

**Revoltz,** a joint venture between Medigus, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Charging Robotics Ltd., and Amir Zaid and Weijian Zhou, the founders of EMuze, is a privately held company that designs and develops electric micro-mobility vehicles. This month the company has begun the prototype manufacturing of its micro mobility vehicle.

**E- Commerce**

On August 31, 2021, MDGS, announced that its affiliate Gix Internet (36.74% on a fully diluted bases) (TASE: GIX), a global marketing technology (MarTech) solutions company for online performance-based-marketing, announced that Gix Internet’s subsidiary, Gix Media signed a definitive agreement for the purchase of 70% at Cortex Group.

**Digital Marketing**

Jeff’s Brands Ltd., and its subsidiaries Smart Repair Pro, Purex and Top Rank, leverage proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to analyze sales data and patterns within the multi-billion-dollar Amazon marketplace to identify stores, niches, and products with demonstrated growth potential to maximize sales within their Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) shops.

**Potential near-term catalysts and milestones:**

Any development in Polyrizon toward FDA approval.

MUSE engaging in more licenses and sales agreements.

Commercializing new sectors for Scoutcam.

Launching of new products at Gix Group.

**10/22/2020 Aegis Initiated Coverage Buy $6.00**

6|$ATER TECHNICAL STRATEGY FOR WEEK 9-20|5|pr7jjs|Trading|https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/pr7jjs/ater_technical_strategy_for_week_920/|0|"This is my strategy for $ATER going into the week.

[9\/20 WEEK PLAN](https://preview.redd.it/bazo6lrs2jo71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d1ceea1fc8bded19826893e9349b8fb2ce73c2d)

Here are the strengths that supports this plan:

1. Support at 9.00 – 9.14 held beautifully with a **RETEST**
2. EMA10 was RECLAIMED, which $ATER has **RESPECTED EMA10 SINCE 8/31**
3. **Rebound off EMA21 with Oops Reversal** (buyers bought back in after realizing they’re stops were hit BELOW EMA10, touched EMA21 for shake out)
4. **Bullish outside bar** that covers **2 prior candles**

**I SAID BEFORE THAT REPSPECTING EMA10** **IS A SIGN OF A MOTHER STOCK.** **THE BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED ABOVE IS WHAT A MONSTER STOCK DOES !!**

Bears printed a MOTHER BAR that, once broken, will trigger the next MONSTER RUN. After the resistance is broken, the next target is the all time high (ATH) at 19.10 which is not too extended for Bulls to take out. Volume has been acting well and there has been more accumulation volume than distribution. Volume also increased on bull runs and dries up on the pullback (a sign of consolidation). Holders not selling, which can be seen by below average volume.

Let review what MOTHER BARS are and why they are important:

**Mother bars** are candles with a wide range and above average volume. Above average volume is needed to ""strengthen"" the move. The wider the range, the more difficult to break the highs and lows.

Shorts must break the lows to signal those waiting on the sidelines that price will drop and the momentum from **""new shorts"" entering the trade** will decrease the price.

Likewise, a break above the highs of these bars is a signal for **""new bulls"" waiting to enter** and those entering the trade will drive momentum and price upwards.

The closer the targets, whether long or short, the **easier the momentum** for price to go in a direction.

Like always, we want to **check continuity**, which both the monthly and weekly shows being **upward**:

[MONTHLY CONTINUITY](https://preview.redd.it/vt3d8cqv2jo71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=44872adf81cb89932f71d7d124d1a55c87bf208e)

[WEEKLY CONTINUITY](https://preview.redd.it/xajb8o8x2jo71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f4c7ea2cebd7e71ed6a2d286e63c0f6351cf5cc)

What I’ll be watching for is the break of the mother bar for **HUGE** momentum. Again, there are strengths that support this move:

1. **Support was confirmed**
2. **EMA10 was reclaimed**
3. **Respect EMA10 is a monster characteristic**, which $ATER has shown since 08/31
4. **Bullish outside bar** printed after the **inside bar (indecision)** shows that direction is **UP**
5. **Oops Reversal below EMA10 and rebound off EMA21**

[SUPPORT](https://preview.redd.it/2tqskaf13jo71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e462e17650ba2d5692780eb6910217de9e42bd)

[OOPS REVERSAL](https://preview.redd.it/yavzno043jo71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=dec041ccd36bcb563a9e3c61a4be542a512aa200)

Remember that breaking the high of the prior bar will signal **“new bulls”** to enter.  Nevertheless, we have to think in terms of **probabilities and examine risks**. Will the support be tested again? Maybe…But there is evidence indicating a low likelihood:

1. Shorts are **fighting against continuity**
2. The pullback to 9.14 could not break consolidation **support** 9.00.
3. There was a dry up volume and below average volume, which shows players are **not willing to sell**.
4. **Support was tested** and the day finished a **bullish outside bar** that closed above the prior high.
5. There an expectation with continued uptrend with **Oops Reversal**

Shorts / profit takers have to remember that an attempt at break support and EMA10 had **ALREADY FAILED**. What is the likelihood of success the 2nd try? The 1st attempted ended in an outside bar closing above the prior high. This **outside bar has a bigger range** as well, **covering both candles.** Holders are not selling neither (shown by the low volume) so where will the short momentum come from?

All signs point to Bulls having the advantage.

Let’s take a look at targets. It will not be an easy task for bulls neither b/c volume is needed to break the Bear Mother Bar. Will volume show? The **continuity is UP**. There is a potential as there are signs of **strength**. Past volume has been monstrous. If volume does show, the targets are:

1. Last candle high 11.97 will be a signal for “new bulls” to enter the trade and momentum will build.
2. Bear mother bar high 16.68 is next.
3. Last week’s high 19.10 is very close.
4. 21.07 is last month’s high.

[9\/20 WEEK PLAN](https://preview.redd.it/s6tkdgp63jo71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2100f22b57380d0526f1455cd3ce780b66b442d)

Breaking the highs of longer timeframes are stronger signals as they are typically harder to break. Why? Longer timeframes reduces volatility and shows the trend direction. Thus, **breaking a high on a longer timeframe triggers a stronger signal because it validates the trend.**

Notice that 22.19 is both a prior weekly and monthly high. Taking out 2 highs in 1 break will trigger a MASSIVE run. How big? We will have to see!

Also, I get a lot of question about indicators. There is not one indicator that will predict movement. ALL INDICATORS ARE LAGGING. Indicators have information only AFTER a move is complete. This is why it’s so important to examine the behavior of a stock and think in terms of probabilities.

**APPLY THE TECHNIQUE DISCUSSED !!**

We know that continuity is up and the bear mother bar high will be broken (yes, will be, shorts / profit takers already failed).  Break the daily chart down to timeframes you feel comfortable, which I'm using the 30min.  This way, you'll be able to see the different levels going into this.

[30 MIN](https://preview.redd.it/hg3k6elm5ko71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=43705d0671b3e41930284b5563b09b3da08c3571)

This should be a great exercise for the community so that we can all help eachother get insight into why you would hope for a dip on a certain stock….. At what price, and what you are looking for.

We need to try and be realistic because some readers may also look at this idea, do DD and may thank you later. By saying you hope AMZN dips to 1,500, or MRNA to 200, GOOG to 1,000. I am not sure if you are helping anyone, because I believe most would jump in too!

Now if these are indeed a ticker you await a dip, maybe you can set a realistic price and just an idea of where it may go. It is a simple exercise, would be better of course if you actually did own it before, really would buy it back and maybe where you may see it months from now.

I have about 1,200 tickers on 29 watch lists, so I have many to choose from. Some have never heard of this ticker and so it may help many just to get an idea.

ZIM, I have been a trader of this since it IPO’d. The company is a cargo shipper that has absolutely beat the last 3 earnings reports badly! They reported earnings over 7 dollars recently with a 2 dollar special dividend. The stock has run to an all time high near $60…..

I hope this dips back to 45, it was there a few weeks ago… and in a year if they keep executing this can be 75-90. They make cash and can pay dividends. Yes, rates are high now, yes ports are backed up, but they will still beat top and bottom line.

We would like to hear from you! Thank you."|1631930969.0

&#x200B;

I am looking to start trading with software I am writing. I want to start small, say with an account of about 3000E.

Looking for brokers is a daunting thing, very messy, difficult to compare and most of them seem shady. 

Ideally I'd find a broker:

1) that is regulated in EU

2) offers CFD, FX, futures 

3) has an api available for non professional accounts, that is well documented

4) tight spreads, low comissions

&#x200B;

I was looking into IG and XTB. Both have a decent api (it seems). IG seems more expensive (is it?), but better regulated. Also, I feel that these brokers are quite opaque in their dealings. I would not be surprised if suddenly it turns out that for whatever I want to do some unexpected cost suddenly appears, or it turns out that I am betting against the broker and subsequently losing more than Ii should.

Someone makes a few hundred thousands or even millions of $ investing and trading.

Why would they want to charge for a course or program to teach others?

If what they teach doesn't hurt them as an investor (some secret strategy that when spread to the world would make it less effective) then they EITHER have no motivation to charge 2 to 10k when they can easily make that money on their own with no responsibility towards others, salesmanship and hours spent working for someone else OR they can do it for free, if they really want to help others and THAT is their true motivation and they feel like they have a mission or a vocation of sorts.

But why charge for it and turn something that makes you free into just another job where you have to respond to others?

*$ATER price action has come to a pivot point between short and bulls. At a time like this, the thing I try to do is check my emotion and look at the big picture.

I saw that there was more accumulation than distribution.

I recalled that the MA’s (EMA10, EMA21, SMA50) have just aligned in an orderly fashion.

Next, I evaluated the compound mother bar, consolidation, and potential support levels.

[ PRIOR DAY, 9\/16  ](https://preview.redd.it/up2ovnbrm4o71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3b24f63cf508aaa972a9ab731ae07c93d137067)

I sat through the price action and watch levels tip toe around the support. **Consolidation support @ 9.00** could not be broken. I let the price action tell me if there was strength, which revealed itself as time went on. I watched for price to get back into the range, which it did. Next was a **break of the inside bar top 10.98**, which was a potential for momentum as **“new bulls”** enter. After breaking 10.98, price spiked **past the 11.72 resistance with ""new bulls"" joining the strength**.

**Support levels were confirmed today**. The low of the pullback 9.34 **displayed** the level for possible support and the price action at this level was kept in mind. Today’s action confirmed the support and **range is** **now defined**.

Today was a **BULLISH OUTSIDE BAR** which is important for new **“price discovery”**. The low will be **harder for shorts to break as support is confirmed**. There are “new bulls” that entered after the break of the prior bar high. From here on, more “new bulls” will enter as a **break of prior highs will signal a long** and this is how momentum builds.

**Volume was higher** than yesterday.  I experimented with a 14 day moving average and changed it to 30 as this better suits my technique in analyzing the extreme volume in $ATER.

Today was an OOPS, REVERSAL. Who remembered me bringing this up? Did you keep EMA10 in mind? How long did I say PRICE RESPECTED EMA10? Right, since 08/31.  See that today’s open was below EMA10 and price rebound above it. OPPS REVERSAL

Where do we go from here? I think price will continue in the 9.35 - 11.72 range before the next breakout. Why? The price action needs to **consolidate** (exchange shares from sellers to buyers). But then again, **no one knows for sure** and we will need to continue watching.

Last but not least, practice putting the pieces of information together. Did the close 9.96 and spinning top candle printed yesterday cause you a lot of **STRESS**? Were you able to formulate a strategy yesterday? This is a skill you must develop in order to pave your own path. **No emoji, gifs, nor cheering will help you**. This is how you will grow your account, whether it’s 1K or 1M.

If you haven’t read my previous posts, $ATER SHORTS HAVING MOTHER BAR PROBLEMS PT 1 + 2, I recommend that you do so. The discussions will continue around the principles from those initial posts.  Consequently, my posts will get shorter as I wouldn’t need to repeat analysis techniques.

Thank you for reading. Have a good weekend!"|1631912052.0
